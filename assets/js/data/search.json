    "content": "The way people express themselves and exhibit their identities to the outside world is reflected in fashion and lifestyle, which are closely intertwined. In order to show one’s personality, mood, and cultural identity through their choice of clothing, accessories, and makeup, people utilise fashion as a means of self-expression.In contrast, lifestyle refers to how a person leads their life, including their customs, principles, and perspectives on things like work, play, health, and relationships.  Since it can reveal one’s interests, values, and priorities, fashion is frequently an element of one’s lifestyle.Culture, region, age, and socioeconomic status are just a few examples of the many variables that can have a significant impact on fashion and lifestyle trends. External variables like technology, politics, and the economy can also have an impact on them.In general, fashion and lifestyle may be a creative and entertaining way for people to express themselves and discover many facets of who they are. To be attentive of our decisions and their effects, we must keep in mind that fashion and lifestyle choices can also have a huge impact on the environment and society.NEEDS TO BE MUST HAVE??You must have come across the word “MUST HAVE” during the heyday of social media! Wait, what must have this? Should possess knowledge? …. No! essential college attire! Shoes are a must!The try-on campaign! Sharing user reviews on social media platforms might benefit both those who are buying and utilising the product. nevertheless, what about the viewers?The audience’s desire to purchase that thing can have an impact on one’s budget. Youths are the affected and desired audience! They are simple to persuade and open to experimenting with trends, which is why.Nevertheless, they are not aware of how much money they are spending on things that are unnecessary.The desire to dress in the latest fashion will never go away. But the primary problem is that it is reaching its height and simply making people want 20 pairs of heels, shoes, clothes, or many different kinds of goods.Fashion at what extent of life???Fashion and lifestyle trends may put pressure on people to adhere to particular ideas or standards, which may cause those who don’t meet those standards to feel inadequate or low in self-esteem.Financial strain: Those who feel the need to buy new clothes, accessories, or other products on a regular basis may experience financial strain or debt as a result of trying to keep up with fashion and lifestyle trends.Environmental impact: The production and disposal of clothing and other items contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, water pollution, and other environmental issues. The fashion industry is a significant source of environmental waste.Labour problems: A lot of fashion and lifestyle products are produced in factories or other settings where employees are subjected to subpar working conditions, low pay, and other labour problems.Reinforcing negative preconceptions: Fashion and lifestyle trends can support negative societal norms and stereotypes about gender, race, body type, and other aspects that can support discrimination and injustice.Handcraft: A help or a market strategy???It’s critical to be aware of these potential negative effects and to take action to lessen them. Some suggestions for doing this include shopping more sustainably, supporting businesses that uphold fair labour standards, and opposing damaging stereotypes and ideals in the fashion and lifestyle sectors.It’s true that in recent years, handmade goods and crafts have grown in popularity as more and more consumers seek for original, genuine goods manufactured by experienced artists. It is also true, though, that many of the people who produce these handmade goods do not necessarily reap substantial benefits from this trend.The growth of mass-produced goods that resemble the appearance and feel of handmade objects, frequently at a lesser price, is one factor contributing to this. True craftsmen and craftspeople may find it challenging to compete in the market as a result, as they may not be able to offer the same prices or volume of goods as larger, more commercially oriented businesses.Also, there could be difficulties with marketing and distribution of handmade goods because many craftsmen do not have the means or know-how to advertise their goods and reach a large audience.There are programmes and organisations that try to assist and promote the work of artists and crafters, so despite these difficulties, there are still many individuals who cherish and appreciate the beauty and originality of handcrafted goods. For instance, there are shops and online stores that focus on selling handmade goods, as well as groups that help craftsmen and crafters in developing nations by offering them assistance, resources, and training.In the end, it’s crucial for customers to be aware of the origins of the handmade goods they purchase and to support the craftsmen and craftspeople who make genuine, high-quality goods. By doing this, we can make sure that the tradition of handcrafted goods thrives and that individuals who produce these lovely pieces of art can profit from their skills and knowledge.Being informed on new styles, tricks, and trends is at times a vital aspect of life, but one must realise that it is only a part of life.     BY AVANTIKA RANA                            "

    "content": "With Fashion, Madhur Bhandarkar demonstrates his prowess as a talented writer oncemore. The director expertly conveys the majority of the depressing and incredibly sadrealities of the fashion industry with a little bit of suprise values assigned. The film’s onlyflaw is that Madhur appears to take his own time, that causes than it otherwise would have,to last longer at 2 hours and 50 minutes instead of the ideal 135 minutes. The use of alcoholand drugs in the second half goes on for too longSource:https://www.amarujala.com/photo-gallery/entertainment/bollywood/madhur-bhandarkar-priyanka-chopra-and-kangana-ranaut-film-fashion-complete-12-years-of-know-unknown-facts-about-filmThe climax is the only defect besides duration. The creators have created a climax that isextremely unrealistic for a film that was so persuasive throughout. The soundtrack andcinematography are flawless.Actors are supposed to be giving great performances, and Madhur Bhandarkar does it oncemore. Priyanka Chopra just gave a performance that should win her an grant. Priyankaought to accomplish with Fashion what Kareena did with Jab We Met. Since she has playeda few back-to-back roles that are similar in the past years, Kangana Ranaut is trulyoverblowing such psycho responsibilities; she requires a revamp. Mugdha Godse is veryattractive in person and on screen. Great job is played by arjan bajwa. The fantastic SamirSoni &amp; Harsh Chhaya. Remarkably, Arbaaz Khan seems to be very successful.Being called realistic while being extremely pessimistic and stereotypical falls flat. I wouldn’tsay that Bhandarkar’s earlier works were any different or particularly upbeat because theytypically show the dark side of their subjects, but this one takes things even further. Themovie teaches us that in the world of fashion, everything—sorry, EVERYTHING—representation of reality. This film does not present both sides of an issue, as should bedone if youis bad. This includes sex (which isn’t necessarily bad, but the movie is mostlyabout infidelity &amp; premarital sex), drinking, drugs, sadness, hopelessness. There is nothingpositive about it, and it is obviously false . I really want to create an issue-based movie.In addition, despite its humorous exaggeration, it largely portrays gay men in stereotypicalroles. The main problem with the first half of the movie is Priyanka’s personality. She’s notintroduced as a sweet little girl; rather, she’s portrayed as a total moron, which is strangecoming from someone who claims she wishes to be a “supermodel” and the fashion industry.A girl who aspires to be a supermodel can’t possibly be that shy, in my opinion. Another flawis how the director abruptly demonstrates the girl drinking and smoking without giving anywarning. This change happened far too quickly to be plausible.In any case, the technical aspects of the movie are excellent. Okay, relative. Although it wasfairly well shot, there are many major technical flaws, the worst of which being the truly awfulnoise and the subpar dubbing. The movie moves along steadily aside from theaforementioned issues. Even though the the conversation is occasionally quite unoriginal,the screenplay is passable, and the drama is not overdone. The conclusion offers awell-deserved breath of relief, even though it’s not entirely happy. However, it is visually quitestunning, the music is excellent (“Kuch Khaas Hai” and “Maar Jaawan” are two of myfavorite recent Hindi songs), the sets and costumes seems suitable, and the actors are castwell.

    "content": "The harsh truth of fast fashion hides itself behind the glitter and glamor of social pictures of a generation who does not wishes to repeat an outfit.The OOTD- outfit of the day is turning into DOTD - Disaster of the decade.It becomes increasingly difficult to overlook the unpleasant reality of the fashion industry as we learn more about it. There is a dire need for change in the fashion industry, from the exploitation of laborer and young workers to the devastation of our planet and the harm done to animals.Imagine a little child toiling away in a factory for long hours under risky circumstances merely to satisfy the need for quick and inexpensive clothing. Consider the harm and risk caused when plastic waste from the manufacturing of clothing enters the stomachs of threatened sea turtles. The impact that our choices in clothing have on the world around us is heart breaking.We have the power to change things as customers. We can use following simple starting points to help save our planet:Start by deciding on eco-friendly and sustainable materials that are less hazardous to the environment, such as organic cotton, hemp, or recycled textiles. We can lessen our reliance on quick fashion and have a beneficial influence on the earth by spending money on high-quality items that are ageless and adaptable.One way to determine whether a piece is a good investment is to use a formula called the “30 wears rule”. It is a calculation that can be used to judge whether an item is a wise purchase. Simply ask yourself if you can envision yourself wearing an item at least 30 times before you buy it. If the response is affirmative, then the investment is probably wise.Not only should we choose our clothing carefully, but we need to also reconsider how we wear and style it. A single article of clothing can be dressed in a variety of ways to produce various looks, which can help the garment last longer and decrease waste.We can also look at buying used items, which not only saves money but also lessens the influence that garment production has on the environment.Another method to support sustainable fashion is by purchasing Indian artisanal clothing, which not only supports Indian craftspeople but also encourages sustainable and environmentally good practices.As Anne Marie Bonneau said, “We do not need a handful of people doing zero waste perfectly. We need millions of people doing it imperfectly.” Let’s strive to make imperfect but conscious choices towards a more sustainable fashion industry.Dhairya Mishra"

    "content": "“Fashion is an art and you are the canvas.” I interviewed Shreya Jain, a fashion stylist and enthusiast to know her take on fashion.1.What is your definition of “fashion” ?For me fashion can be defined as a popular or prevailing style of clothing, accessories, makeup, or hair, especially in the context of a particular time, place, or culture. It is a form of self-expression and a way for individuals to convey their personality, tastes, and social status through what they wear. Fashion is not limited to clothing but also includes trends in footwear, jewellery, bags, hairstyles, and makeup. It is a constantly evolving industry that is influenced by various factors such as culture, technology, politics, and art, among others.2.  What ethics do you think are most important in the fashion industry?I think there are several important ethics that are crucial for the fashion industry to uphold. Like the fashion industry should ensure that the people who make the clothes and accessories are treated fairly and paid a living wage. This includes providing safe working conditions and prohibiting forced labor.It should work towards reducing its impact on the environment by reducing waste and pollution, using eco-friendly materials and production methods, and promoting circularity.The fashion industry should be transparent about its production processes, including where materials are sourced and how garments are made. This allows consumers to make informed decisions about the products they purchase.Overall I think the fashion industry should strive to create a more ethical and sustainable future, one that values people and the planet as much as it values profits .  How has fashion influenced Indian cinema?Fashion has had a significant influence on Indian cinema, and the relationship between the two industries is a symbiotic one. Indian cinema, also known as Bollywood, has been a major platform for fashion trends and has helped popularise certain styles and designs.In the early days of Indian cinema, actors and actresses were often seen wearing traditional Indian clothing, such as sarees and salwar kameez. However, as the industry evolved and began to cater to a more global audience, fashion became an increasingly important part of the films.4.How Does Celebrity Fashion Affect Teen’s Self Image?Celebrity fashion can have a significant impact on teenagers’ self-image. Many teenagers look up to celebrities as role models and often try to emulate their style and appearance. When celebrities promote certain fashion trends, it can lead to a surge in popularity of those trends among teenagers. It’s important for teenagers to be aware of these issues and to approach celebrity fashion with a critical eye. While it can be fun to experiment with different styles and trends, it’s important to prioritise self-acceptance and individuality over conforming to societal beauty standards. Teenagers should also strive to be mindful of the impact that their own fashion choices may have on others, and should work towards promoting inclusivity and diversity in the fashion industry.  Do you agree that fashion goes round in circles?it’s important to note that while certain styles may resurface, they are often reinterpreted and updated to suit modern tastes and sensibilities. Additionally, new trends and styles also emerge constantly, so it’s not entirely accurate to say that fashion only goes round in circles. Fashion is a dynamic and ever-evolving industry, and while there may be elements of nostalgia and retro style, there is always room for new and innovative ideas.  Do you think that men’s fashion reflect changes in male gender roles?Yes, men’s fashion can reflect changes in male gender roles. Fashion has always been an important means of self-expression and a way for individuals to communicate their identity and values to others. As societal attitudes and expectations towards gender roles have evolved over time, so too has men’s fashion.Today, men’s fashion is characterised by a greater diversity of styles, with men expressing themselves through a wide range of clothing choices, including streetwear, sportswear, and gender-neutral fashion. This shift in men’s fashion reflects a broader cultural shift towards more inclusive and fluid gender roles, with men feeling freer to express themselves and challenge traditional expectations of masculinity.7.Lastly, do you think that fashion is truly a form of “self expression” ?Yes, definitely fashion can be a powerful mode of self-expression. What we choose to wear can communicate a lot about our personality, values, and beliefs. Our clothing choices can signal our identity, our cultural affiliations, and our social status. Fashion can be a way of telling the world who we are and what we stand for.By: Kashish Kanwar"

    "content": "India and festivals—the two things that can never be separated. It would not be wrong if anyone called India a synonym of festivals, and April is remarkably amazing in this aspect. April arrives, bringing the notorious April Fool’s Day with it.Reflecting “Unity in Diversity,”, we have Mahaveer Jayanti (April 4) on the one hand and Easter on the other. Mahaveer Jayanti, the most auspicious day of the Jain community, marks the birth of Lord Mahaveer, while Easter marks the resurrection of Lord Christ, making it one of the most important religious festivals for Christians. The whole of India was filled with zeal, celebrating each of the festivals with utmost devotion. Talking about devotion, how can we forget mentioning Hunuman Jayanti, the Eid Al Fitr, the holy month of Ramadan, and the Holy Week of Christians? In short, this April was filled with auspiciousness and joy. And thus, Baisakhi is worth mentioning here, which marks the establishment of Khalsa, making it a very important day for the followers of Sikhism.And how can we forget about the lustrous green fields of Punjab, ready for harvesting, while talking about Baisakhi? Often celebrated with dhol and bangra, it reflects the happiness of the agrarian community, which has worked hard in the fields from sowing to harvesting, thus getting the crop ready to satisfy the hunger of the entire country. Bihu, the unique festival of Assam, is celebrated three times a year, but the one celebrated in April, Rongali Bihu, marks the advent of the Assamese New Year with the magnificent Bihu dance. The same day also marks the Tamil Nadu New Year, Puthandu, and the astonishing Pongal, along with delicious food and magnificent sweets. And to add to the zeal of this day, Kerala’s Vishnu Kani is worth mentioning. Pohela Baishak of West Bengal can’t be excluded from the list. Both of these festivals mark the New Year in their respective states and are glorified in the various folk tales citing reasons for the celebration of these festivals.The month also attaches us to the grand history of the Indian freedom movement. 13 April, the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre Day, fills every Indian with a spirit of patriotism. Talking about history, how can we forget about World Heritage Day (18 April)? After all, we are a country full of heritages.And the month still has something very significant, not only for India but for the whole world: Earth Day (April 22)).What a fantastic April, and we, as humans, can grasp a number of things from this month. It teaches us to care for our mother earth. It teaches us the importance of our heritage. It reminds us of the struggle and sacrifice of our freedom fighters to build present-day India. It teaches us to practise moral values and spirituality. It nurtures the feelings of secularism and “Unity in Diversity”. It honours the hard work of the farmers to feed the entire country. It teaches us how each day is precious. Indeed, what an amazing April!By -ADITI DANDRIYAL"

    "content": "You know how its said that every 100km in India will take you to a new country ? Well it’s absolutely true. India being such a vast and diverse country has its people celebrating the same festival in various ways. Even amongst such diversity , one common thread seems to bind all of  us together and that is agriculture and harvest.April brings with itself the harvest of Rabi crops. This first harvest is also considered as New Year for people who are native to Northern, Eastern and Southern parts of India. The mid of April is the busiest month for the farmers across our nation. The mid of April is filled with harvest festivals such as Baisakhi, Bihu, Vishu , Poila Boishak, Puthandu, Ugadi, Gudi Padwa and many more other such harvest festivities. Harvest festivals are believed to be the oldest form of festivals around the world .Harvest festivals are deeply rooted in tradition , but also reflect the contemporary values and needs of the people who celebrate them.  Harvest festivals in India is a traditional celebration that marks the end of the growing season and the gathering of crops. These  festivals are quite a commemoration of our evolution into a settled agrarian society.A long weekend of celebrations that the urban population usually affiliates  with vacationing is in fact, prominent for the farmers and his family. Harvesting is the most labour intensive task and especially in this season it burdens small farmers with little to no equipments. Harvest festivals are not just festivals where the farmers brings out the produce that they have been working on since the past 6-7 months but it’s a festival where we can give back to them, a token of appreciation for all their hardwork to feed us, our families and our nation.The coming week will begin with all of us celebrating Baisakhi. All of us are aware that Baisakhi is a harvest festival but it also holds a significant meaning for the people of Punjab. It was initially celebrated to commemorate the foundation of Khalsa group, by Guru Gobind Singh and it is the day when the Jallianwala Bagh massacre took place , the reason why people pay homage to the martyrs of the massacre. Baisakhi is predominately celebrated in Punjab , Haryana and western parts of UP. But the celebration is not just confined to these areas, the essence of it is felt across the nation. The way of celebration is different and unique to everyone . The farmers when they see their crop all ready , they thank the god and pray to them for the country’s happiness, greenery and prosperity. People express their happiness through small charities and langars , visiting temples and Bhangra. Such festivals reminds us to be grateful to the farmers . Farmers get very little for the amount of hardwork that they put it.  For the  amount of crops that they produce throughout the year , they only receive a handful. Many farmers die due to starvation , they end their lives because they don’t have a single grain of rice that they produced to feed themselves or their family , but they do make sure that our families are being fed. This season of harvest let’s become better humans  and provide them with the love , appreciation and a good healthy lifestyle that they deserve . _by: Shreya Nair _"

This does not entail eliminating significant food groups from your diet or restricting the number of calories you consume each day. A balanced diet includes the majority of food groups at each meal. Including meats, dairy, fruits, and vegetables in your meals will help to keep your body healthy.The foundations of a healthy lifestyle are a balanced diet, regular exercise, and enough sleep. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle lowers your risk of disease and keeps you active and fit. The WHO defines healthy living as a way of life that enables you to take advantage of more aspects of your life. It is a way of life that reduces the risk of developing a serious illness or passing away too soon. It’s not enough to be healthy to stay free from illness or disease. It also has to do with one’s social, mental, and physical wellbeing.When you lead a healthy lifestyle, you set a better example for your family members, especially your children. Additionally, you’ll improve the environment in which they can develop. You will improve their health and quality of life and future happiness in life by encouraging them to improve the nutritional quality.You live much longer and are pleased if you lead a healthy lifestyle. One in four Indians is now at risk of dying from non-communicable diseases like diabetes, heart disease, or cancer before they turn 70 due to the rising pervasiveness of lifestyle diseases in India. Unhealthy habits like a poor diet, inactivity, erratic sleeping patterns, and abusing alcohol or tobacco excessively could cause you to join the 38 million Americans who are constrained by one or more chronic health problems.We cannot maintain our health if we have bad habits. Alcohol, tobacco, a lack of exercise, and junk food are all very bad for your health. The ability to control one’s willpower is crucial for breaking bad habits. Make a commitment to maintaining a healthy lifestyle for a longer, healthier life.You probably know when your health isn’t at its best. Possibly all you feel is “off.” You might notice that you’re run down, that your digestion isn’t working as well as it usually does, and that you keep getting colds. Mentally, you might find that you have trouble focusing and experience anxiety or depression.You may feel better if you lead a healthy lifestyle. And you don’t have to change everything about your life overnight. A few small changes you can make to improve your well-being are fairly simple to implement. And after you implement one change, your success may spur you on to implement additional constructive changes.  BY MEENAKSHI"

    "content": "Have you ever considered how much of an impact your health can have on your life? Your physical health has a significant impact on your overall quality of life, affecting everything from your mood to your level of energy. Tragically, numerous dangers to our well-being can crash our arrangements and leave us feeling powerless. The H3N2 influenza virus, which has been causing health professionals concern in recent years, is one such threat.What is H3N2 influenza?In 1968, the H3N2 influenza strain was first observed in Hong Kong. It quickly spread to other nations, including the United States, from there. In September 1968, the first H3N2 influenza outbreak occurred in the United States. It quickly spread across the country, triggering a pandemic that lasted until 1970. Since then, H3N2 has evolved into a seasonal flu virus with global distribution and annual outbreaks. The annual flu vaccine contains the virus, which is still present worldwide.How did it emerge?It is believed that genetic reassortment led to the emergence of H3N2 influenza. This happens when two unique seasonal viruses ( human flu virus and an avian flu virus for this situation) taint a similar host cell and trade hereditary material, bringing about another virus with an alternate mix of qualities from the original viruses.How did it spread?H3N2 influenza spreads worldwide through human-to-human transmission and international travel. India may have been infected with H3N2 influenza due to international travel or an infected person entering the country. The virus can quickly spread from person to person once it is introduced to a population, especially in crowded places like schools, offices, and public transportation. In previous flu seasons, H3N2 influenza was reported in India. It will likely continue to be a seasonal flu virus here.WHO and The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India on H3N2 fluThe World Health Organization (WHO) reported that H3N2 and influenza B viruses were among the most prevalent flu viruses worldwide during the 2019–2020 flu season. The World Health Organization (WHO) and The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India intently screen the worldwide flow of flu infections, including H3N2, and give direction and suggestions to nations on influenza counteraction and control techniques.WHO believes H3N2 flu to be one of the most disturbing influenza subtypes because of its capacity to change quickly and cause extreme sickness, especially in more established grown-ups and small kids. WHO says that everyone should get vaccinated against seasonal flu, including H3N2, every year to avoid getting sick and spreading the virus to other people. In addition to vaccinating people, the WHO encourages people to cover coughs and sneezes, wash their hands frequently, and stay inside when they are ill. WHO also recommends taking antiviral medications to treat severe cases of the flu, including H3N2 influenza.It is the responsibility of the Indian government to monitor influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) and to issue periodic reports on the country’s flu virus epidemic. When traveling to areas where flu virus outbreaks are known to have occurred, the health ministry advises travelers to take precautions.What are the symptoms of H3N2 influenza?H3N2 influenza, also known as the H3N2 flu can cause respiratory disease in people. The symptoms of H3N2 influenza are similar to those of other types of influenza and may include fever, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches, fatigue, vomiting, and diarrhea (more common in children). These symptoms typically begin to manifest one to three days after exposure to the virus and can persist for up to a week or more. H3N2 influenza can sometimes result in more serious complications like pneumonia, especially in young children, the elderly, and people with weak immune systems. It is essential to seek medical attention as soon as you suspect you or a loved one has the flu to receive the necessary treatment and avoid complications.Who is at a higher risk?H3N2 influenza can cause death, especially in people who are more likely to get complications. These incorporate small kids, old people, pregnant ladies, and individuals with fundamental ailments like asthma, diabetes, or coronary illness. H3N2 influenza can result in complications like pneumonia, respiratory failure, and even death in severe cases.How to prevent H3N2 influenza?Getting vaccinated, washing your hands frequently, avoiding close contact with sick people, covering your mouth and nose, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces, and taking care of your health are all ways to lower your risk of contracting H3N2 influenza. You can help protect yourself and those around you and lower your risk of contracting H3N2 influenza and other illnesses by following these steps.ConclusionIn conclusion, the H3N2 influenza virus is highly contagious and a significant health risk. Even though outbreaks can be hard to predict and avoid, there are still many things we can do to protect ourselves and our communities. We can lower our chances of getting the virus and spreading it by staying informed, maintaining proper hygiene, and getting vaccinated. It is essential to remember that our health is a valuable resource that necessitates ongoing care as we move forward. We can live happier, healthier lives by making small adjustments to our daily routines and being aware of potential health risks. As a result, let’s pledge to prioritize our health and take preventative measures to stop the spread of the H3N2 influenza virus and other infectious diseases. We can create a future that is healthier and more resilient for ourselves and those around us by working together."

    "content": "Three Firsthand Accounts of a Schizophrenic’s Monthly Trip to the Vault4th April, 2023: On the 18th of March, 2023, a 22 year old student of Mathematics at one of India’s few National Research Institute’s was taken to the ER of three different hospitals in Orissa after passing out on a train to one of her weekly Psychiatric appointments. Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome is a rare condition developed in response to Neuroleptic drugs - the kind your friendly neighborhood psychiatrist will hand out to every Tom, Dick and Harry that spits out to him three Beautiful Mind symptoms out your high school psychology textbook. It’s a strange reaction; NMS. A person will lose lucidity, floating in and out the edge of consciousness and past the point of coherence as his limbs lose motor function, his WBC count drops, immune system gives in. The body stops fighting back.There is no real way to diagnose NMS apart from a prior knowledge of the regular consumption of the offending medication, which makes its identification peculiarly tricky. Nothing tells on it, not your blood, not your CT scan, not your MRI. Your vitals remain normal until they don’t and you drop dead; sepsis spread too fast. A seizure they couldn’t see coming.There is an idea [Patrick Bateman voice] of mental health. Some kind of abstraction. Touchable and watchable, easy on the eyes, and the nose, and the ears, and the flesh. Easy on the mind. And there is a reason for this, it’s that the kind of person that fights for this idea, it’s hobbyisitic defender, is too weak to handle anything more. Chitra Banerjee* was in the ICU for over a week at the super specialty of the very hospital that had been treating her for the appreciable and cinematic mental disease assortment of Schizophrenia, Depression, Anxiety and General Psychosis. Here are three days’ accounts of what it actually means to bear witness to something like this.I - The Players      The First Responders: Chitra’s college batch mates and friends who brought her to KIMS on the day of. Maitreyi, Gautam, Sumedh and Anand.        The Psychiatrists: Dr. Deepthi and Dr. Sudipto, the two Psychiatrists overseeing Chitra’s treatment at KIMS for the past seven months.        The Family: Dr. Banerjee, a consultant physician based in Delhi and Chitra’s mother, and her other daughter Priyanjita.  II - The IncidentMarch 18 - Morning**Maitreyi: **“Chitra’s been sort of unconscious for some time now. Not fully unconscious, just very sleepy. We were headed to KIMS for her appointment, and she was fine at her room, but then she got really sleepy in the train, and she hasn’t woken up since. We’ve spoken to the doctors at KIMS, and this is supposedly normal, it’s nothing to worry about. We’re going to take her back to college, so that the ambulance can take her to KIMS. There’s nothing to worry about.Everything is fine.”March 18 - AfternoonGautam: “We reach [KIMS] by around twelve-twelve thirty. She is on a stretcher, then we take her in. This nurse comes around, she’s staring at us. Maitreyi and Anand go in to take care of the billing, and I stay outside with her. And the nurse asks - says, ”Kya hua?” but she doesn’t she really say it to me. She actually - she, what I can only describe as - slaps Chitra. And asks her, “Kya hua?” Which is very ridiculous, because she very clearly looks like she’s not conscious. Not like she’s sleeping, but like she’s unconscious.“I don’t even really register it, that this is happening. She ignores me - I’m sitting beside her head, she could’ve asked me, but she chose not to - and then leaves. I doubt she was ever actually interested. I’ve never really been in Hospitals before. I didn’t know this is how it is. I didn’t expect this kind of apathy. I didn’t expect them to be this ruthless.“We go through the billing, and we move her to bed number four. They were asking us a few questions inside, there was one doctor. The billing was also a very - a very slow, very unnecessarily long procedure. And from then on it was just waiting. You’d expect that in a hospital - in an emergency ward, no less - if there were an emergency, that they’d do something about it. Something would happen. But nothing does. People come around, ask what’s going on. Oh, she’s unconscious? Very well. And then they leave. It’s certainly a very horrifying reminder of just how apathic the hospital system is. It’s the kind of place where I can very easily envision someone dying, which is a funny thing to say about a hospital floor. Actually, if someone dies here, I’d say it -”Interviewer: “- makes sense.”**Gautam: **“Makes a frightening amount of sense.”March 18 - Evening**Maitreyi: **“They still have no idea what’s going on with her. She can’t stay in the Emergency anymore. They’re saying she has to be shifted to either the ICU or the OPD of the psychiatric department. We asked them to shift her to the ICU, but they want to speak to a family member. They don’t tell us much anyway.“We tell them that her mother will be here by tomorrow, but they insist on speaking with her now. It turns out this is because the ICU is apparently full, and they can’t keep her there, and the Psych OPD doesn’t have critical care. You might wonder why they’re even bothering telling us this then, if there’s nothing to be done. What’s the point? Well, the point is, that lucky for us, while there are no beds in their hospital’s regular ICU, there are beds in their Super Specialty ICU, a costlier subsection of their hospital that just so happens to not be covered by Chitra’s student insurance. They need a 25,000 upfront transfer for the first night. I call Chitra’s mother in Delhi before her flight here tomorrow to ask her what’s to be done. She’s a doctor, and she asks to speak to the doctors here. But there are none, except Sudipto and Deepthi, neither of whom are here now. It’s been a hours.”Gautam: “Nothing’s happened this whole time. And by nothing’s happened, I mean nothing’s happened. There’ve been no doctors, no nurses. What doctors have asked what’s happening has been as bystanders. ”Oh! What’s happened here? Oh, so terrible.” Like passersby whispering. Like she’s gossip.“She was not put under medication, she wasn’t even put on saline. She’s just on a bed, and there’s a person behind her. Mostly me. Sometimes Maitreyi or Anand. One person at a time.“Her doctor dropped by quite often, the man. Sudipto. Every 1.5 hours. The Neurology guy hasn’t yet come, but the Psychiatry guys have, the ones treating her. He asked us if she’d taken any drugs, and we told him nothing apart from her meds. Them and cigarettes. He asked us specifically if she’d taken cannabis and we said not that we know of. Did he say anything helpful?”(Dr. Sudipto: “The only thing I can say right now is that she needs to be kept under observation. The psychiatric department can’t do anything here.”)Gautam: “Not really.”March 18 - NightAnand: “He came at around 8. 3-4 times after the ER manager had pestered us to fuck off. He wasn’t not as tall as him, not as well dressed. His smile was what I can only describe as slimy.That guy, I suppose had two motives. He had to get us out of there, either into the Super-specialty ICU, or out of the KIMS entirely. Chitra’s mother had more or less left the decision up to us by then; she’d transferred the money and told us to do whatever we thought best. Whether AMRI or AIIMS or the OPD or the SS. But it was raining outside, and neither AIIMS nor AMRI were responding. And these people would not let Chitra stay in the ER for any longer. “She needs to be under observation,” they’d say. She isn’t critical. Every time we asked them why they wanted to shift her to the ICU. But observation can happen in an OPD. And if indeed she isn’t critical, one has to wonder why they’d even keep her in the ER for that long in the first place. There was something they weren’t telling us.There was nothing they were telling us.”Gautam: “At around 9, a nurse came over to attach an IV. Very quick to action (she hadn’t eaten in 12 hours). Chitra started resisting. She talked a bit then, she’d said, “it hurts.” The nurse held her down, she yelled at her, ”Kya kar rahi ho? Maarungi tumhe.” And she did actually slap - slap Chitra a few times. I was losing my mind. The way it was advertised to us, it was as if this was the only way. That she had to be held down, that this had to be done then. Chitra wasn’t happy about it, she was flapping around. Maitreyi was holding her torso, Anand held one of her sides and a second nurse the other. And I was asked to move down to her feet. To lock them. I thought about slitting the nurse’s throat.It was a [cannula], I don’t know what it’s called. We didn’t know anything about what was going on. They didn’t bother telling us. We aren’t family.I didn’t say anything, because it clearly seems to be a very torturous sort of affair for Chitra. And I would’ve like for it to be over as quickly as possible. She was clearly in pain, she was saying it, in words. The only time she was coherent. She was calling for her mother.“Her knee hit my stomach while she was trying to free herself. And she didn’t say sorry, she couldn’t utter the words. But I remember her looking me in the eyes. They were half closed the entire time, but she looked me in the eyes then. She couldn’t say sorry, but she said sorry. She was co-operative. She just didn’t like the nurses.”Priyanjita: “Maitreyi calls me at around 8 again to confirm my mother’s decision regarding the ICU. I take the opportunity for what it is to get the doctor - eager to come to the phone now to discuss the payment situation - to speak to my and Chitra’s mother. It is an interesting conversation to overhear.“Yes ma’am, about the Super Specialty -”“Yes, hi, I’m Dr. Banerjee speaking , I’m a Physician.”“Oh, alright, ma’am.”“What’s happened to her exactly?”“Uh, we don’t really know. She’s conscious, barely, but confused. We think she may’ve had a seizure, but for now we can just observe her.”“A seizure? Why do you think it was a seizure?”“Well, she’s - she’s confused.”“You think it was a seizure because she’s confused?”“…”“Alright.”“Ma’am, the ER can’t keep her any longer -”“Listen to me carefully. Chitra does not have seizure disorder. She will not just have a seizure -”“She’s been con -”“Right, she’s been confused, and this is why you think she’s had a seizure, right? Something needs to have triggered the seizure. What are you doing to remove the drugs from her system right now?”“We asked her friends if she’s taken any drugs -”“You asked them if she smoked weed. Anyway, she hasn’t been lucid for over 12 hours now. I suggest you carry out a gastric lavage -“We don’t know that she’s overdosed. She’s only been taking the prescribed medicines.”“Whose dosages were recently altered. What does the toxicology report say?”“Uh, we - haven’t done one yet?”“What have you done?”“We’ve been observing her.”“…”“Ma’am, we need to move her from the ER.”“Consider a gastric lavage.”She disconnects the phone. We’ve already spoken to Chitra’s friends at the hospital about the ICU situation. The problem is not where to go, the problem is them not telling us why. We’re not helpless because we’re not poor. Only beggars can’t be choosers.”Anand: “The air of the Multi-Specialty is very different from that of the main hospital. The people there aren’t annoyed for you to be breathing in it. We ended up deciding to move her there that night.We didn’t really have a choice.At the reception, the admissions guy sees me and the man from the ER whose brought me here (the one with the slimy smile) and his mouth splits into a grin. “Ohh naya patient patient! Wo bhi ICU!” I ignore them as I fill out the admission forms. The way that the payment process for the admission works is, you have a quote amount, and you need to pay it only then will you be transferred. We’d asked him about the fee difference before he’d said it would be a minimal change. That minimal change has now gone from 25 thousand to 40.I will have to call Chitra’s mother again.”March 19Sumedh: “Chitra’s mother, Dr. Banerjee, came this morning. They won’t let us see her, the ICU has very strict visiting hours, one hour in the morning and one in the evening. One man allowed at a time. We’ve still been taking shifts, even though we’re no longer needed. Perhaps we can be helpful. Perhaps we never were.“Her mother needs a place to stay, that much I can help with. She’s not a very talkative person, but her phone had died for a while in the evening, so we ended up talking. Chitra still hasn’t woken up. they’d told us she wasn’t critical yesterday, but apparently she still is. Was mumbling nonsense when I saw her, like they’re words, like she believes them to be words, but they’re most certainly not. Her lips are frozen shut. She doesn’t open her eyes. “The doctors still have no idea what’s happened to her. They run tests, all of them come back normal. Then again, Dr. Banerjee said they didn’t run a toxicology for the drugs that she may’ve been taking, or even the ones she actually was. Just a basic one. That seems productive. Like everything they’re doing.“They’ve tied her to her bed. Apparently she was struggling a lot last night when she was moved to the ICU. She’s spent 20 hours there now. Her lips are swollen. Some kind of sepsis. There’s bruises along her body, they keep asking us if someone’s been hurting her. Cigarette burns and cuts on her arms, what proof is there that she does them to herself, they ask. “I don’t know. Why haven’t you done a Gastric lavage?” Dr. Banerjee asks back. I don’t know what a Gastric lavage is. I’d like to know the answer.”**Maitreyi: **“I’d had a conversation with Chitra just this Monday. She’d confessed to me something she hadn’t told another soul. When she was first diagnosed with Schizo back in Jan 2021, apparently she’d been put on an antipsychotic called Haloperidol, that isn’t on her prescriptions anymore. Apparently she hasn’t been able to function without it. I found an ampule of it along with some other capsules and medication in her room today. I’ve given them to her mother today, she’s here now. Although they still don’t think it’s a case of OD, her toxicology report was clear. So was her blood test and her CT scan. Then again, they don’t tell us anything very clearly.“Her medicines make her very sleepy, she hasn’t made it to a single morning lecture in the past 2 weeks. The Haldol helped, I think. Last week they upped her dosage of Arif from 50mg to 200mg. KIMS has never seen a case like this before. Students come around to ask her questions. They add drugs, change drugs, remove them; change dosages. Chitra would tell me, they do this frequently. “They’re experimenting on me,” she used to say. They don’t know what they’re doing.“They don’t know what they’ve done.”March 20Gautam: “I saw her in the morning, today. She’s still tied to the bed. Mumbling nonsense. I was outside in the waiting room with her mother then, before this board of doctors came along and dragged her into a room next to the ICU. I can’t look at her for long.“What are you doing?” The voices from room 1117 are quite clear.“Please sit for a bit.” Her mother genuinely isn’t interested at all.“Do you know somebody who’s trying to harm your daughter?”“Explain to me why I would care about this now?”“There’s cuts and bruises on Chitra’s arms, legs. Cigarette burns. Dr. Banerjee asks them why this is any of their concern. They don’t really have an answer beyond, ”Uh, pata hona chahiye.” But they’re very  adamant in asking. Who is harming her is apparently more imminent a curiosity to them than doing anything whatsoever to mitigate that harm.“What are you doing? Do you even know whats happening to her?”“We have running theories, but - no. We’re thinking of doing an MRI.” They can’t answer. There’s a whole panel of them, 2, maybe 3 doctors, a few juniors; the head nurses, and the best they can come up with is running another worthless test. The start to get defensive.“What are you doing?” Dr. Banerjee asks again when they pry about the scars.“Do you have nothing? Do you have any idea what has happened to her?”No, ma’am, but we have our best doctors on the case. We’re taking care of her.”“Why has nothing been done? Have you done a gastric lavage? You’ve done nothing, you know nothing.”“…”“Have the drugs gone out of her system?”They don’t have an answer.Dr. Banerjee leaves the room.”Maitreyi: Her mother had a meeting with the doctors today, it seems. Chitra’s sister tells me they’re suspecting NMS. Something called Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome. The words mean nothing to me. I take out my phone and type them into the search box. I read through the Wikipedia article that pops through. 1 in 20,000 cases of anti-psychotic consumption result in a complication called NMS, it says. Symptoms are physical rigidity, confusion, seizures, fever, lowered immunity. Under the list of causes is just one item, alone and damning: ‘neuroleptics like Haloperidol.’ConclusionOn the 23rd of March, 3 days after her interventioned diagnosis with NMS, Chitra Banerjee was shifted out of the ICU to the general cabin. 2 days later she was discharged from Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, a private medical institute considered by most to have the best psychiatry and neurology departments in the city, as a surviving case of NMS developed, triggered and only barely diagnosed under its own care.The problem with “mental health” discourse and supposedly “well-intentioned” ignorant activism is just that ignorance cannot be well-intentioned, simply because it cannot, by virtue of being ignorance, be intentioned at all. It wouldn’t be ignorance then, it would be pretense, and for all that it feels like pulling out one’s guts with a bus brake Nirbhaya style to be unironic about irony - the simple truth about social justice warriors is this: they have never been a detestable and disgusting breed of person worthy of being mocked because they care, but because they pretend to.*Name and all others changed for privacy.By: Mouli Sharma"

    "content": "Image credit: amazon.com“ 2..5..7..10 minuteVo ghurte ja raha tha”Let’s make a bet you won’t even move until you watch it completely…. Yes, it’s that kind ofa movie.The start of the movie can itself tell you how much thrill and horror one would watch in thefilm. Now in Indian cinema it is rare to watch horror films without any exorcist, God, priest,Aatmas, or Sayas. It is amazing to watch such a psychological horror thriller without anyBhoots in it and that too with a mental health concept. Director Pawan Kripalani did a fine jobbringing out the story of a woman struggling with agoraphobia. Radhika Apte has truly beenthe USP of the film throughout the story.I must say the film is full of clever storytelling and nerve-wracking performance of a talentedyoung actor, Radhika Apte. Phobia makes you dive deep into what the main character Mehekgoes through, with its brilliant engagement strategy the movie will force you to put yourselfinto the shoes of the character. And by engagement, I mean the slow processes such as ofMehek overcoming her fear and stepping out of the house then running badly as her breath,heart and legs go numb. We as audience can clearly feel the struggle she went through,multiple emotions, surprises, and a frightening thriller comes out really well.A cute excitement was when Mehek finds a friend Nikki who supported her in accomplishingthe sneak peek idea at Mannu’s house. Overall phobia will not let you bore, as you can notimagine what will come next. The film gives a good lesson on mental illness, that is, you cannever claim to be mentally strong, a feisty woman like Mehek developed such a seriousillness and that it was not treated with proper therapies it got even worse. The word phobia isnowadays taken as a common term for fear, this movie will change your perception of whatphobia actually is. We can also witness the strong bond between Mehek and Shaan, Shaan aguy who is portrayed with a lot of patience, smart and loving personality who till end helpsMehek to regain her sanity. Though the plot was fabulously framed, the first half of the filmgenerates curiosity for the viewers but the second half focuses more on the horror aspectrather than actually treating her. At the end, a series of few drastic events helped Radhika topush herself to move out of the apartment and take help from the people she feared the most.The change of Mehek’s apartment made me think that now what more exciting can be seen?Maybe she will fight with her fear, what else can the maker do? But the story within thestory aspect came up. Mehek started to fear and imagine about jia the previous guest of thatapartment who suddenly disappeared from that house with her stuff behind. DirectorKripalani who made his debut with the Ragini MMS (2011) did prove again why his scarepieces are a success.Without a question Phobia is a complete entertainment package.By: Akansha Solanki"

    "content": "On the occasion of ‘World Theatre Day’ _I interviewed an Indian actor and the founder and associative director of the _Atelier theatre, **Mr. Kuljeet Singh. **1. What is the origin of theatre, and how has it evolved over time?Theatrical art is called composite art because it is a blend of rangmanch, nritya, and gaana. If we talk about the history of theatre, then Greeks were the first ones to perform theatre in western civilization. The first arrival of theatre is also disputed, as a few people contest that the Greeks were the first ones, whereas others make references to the evolving Natya Shastra in India. Greek drama and Sanskrit drama are said to be the earliest forms of theatre.2. How does theatre differ from other forms of performing arts, such as dance or music?See, the way the Natya Shastra envisages theatre says that an actor must know how to dance, sing, and act and have all these qualities; only then  an actor is known as an actor. But the west has a different perspective and says that an actor is an actor, a dancer is a dancer, a singer is a singer, and a musician is a musician. The Indian classical tradition sees theatre in a composite way. Talking about modern theatre, we get to see that a particular person has specialisation in a particular field: “I do theatre, and I have ears to listen and understand songs, but I can’t sing one, this does not mean I don’t do theatre.” But in Sanskrit drama, actors also sang and danced; similarly, it happens in varied places like Maharashtra, where folk traditions are followed. In the present generation, having all the qualities in one person is not a prerequisite condition for success in theatre.3. What is the importance of theatre in society and culture?Socially, politically, historically, and culturally, many movements take place, and they led to changes in the process and content of performing theatre. First, we must know the meaning of culture and what it is. If you say that culture is increasing through theatre, then that is an ambiguous statement. Culture is the way we speak, and our values that can be understood by our stand with or against the establishment. “Culture encompasses what you and I do today and not what my previous generations did.” It includes everything, whether it is rangmanch, geet, etc. We must understand the idiom of what we are doing today. Culture basically catches that idiom. There is no doubt that theatre presents such things as performances. In a way, theatre is a reflection of our thinking. And culture is our thinking. “So, culture develops our thinking, and theatre reflects it.”4. What are some of the most famous plays or playwrights in theatre that inspire you?Mahesh Elkunchwar’s famous play “Holi” has a character who is a lame university student. I performed this play when I was in college. I really like this character and the play. Later, a film was also made on this. He is a Marathi playwright and has also written plays in English.I like many of Vijay Tendulkar’s plays. “Silence! The Court is in Session” is another favourite play of mine.5. What is the difference between a comedy and a tragedy in theatre for you? Which one interests you?The Greeks have defined tragedy and they have a tradition of it. Aristotle has defined full-fledged tragedy in his writings, but in India we don’t have full-fledged tragedy but we have tragic elements. “Abhigyan shakuntalam,” a play by Kalidas, also has tragic elements, but in Sanskrit drama we don’t get to see the Greek ones. In the 18th and 19th centuries, we saw arrival of British companies in India to perform theatre.Comedies are of different kinds. For example, slapstick comedy, sitcom comedy, situational comedy, etc. I personally don’t have a preference as such. Whether it is comedy, tragedy, nukkad, daastaan, or any other form, if it is concerned with humans then it is good no matter what genre we pick. The plays of Dario Fo were political satires which were humorous as well as had a message. I only prefer comedies that have a human concern.6. What all goes into the preparation of a play?There are a lot of people involved in it, as it is an engaging and demanding affair.7. How has technology like sound, projection, and lights impacted theatre in recent years?There has been a lot of development. Earlier, the actor was the centre of theatre, but now technology has replaced it. The evolution of theatre can be seen in things like lighting, background, and projection, which is also called 3D mapping and has been used as a medium since the 2000s. Early on, before the 1990s, not much lighting was used. So, with technological advancements, theatre is also evolving._8. One line to define theatre through your lens. _We should not define it in just a sentence as it would be disrespectful to attribute something to theatre as it is a huge affair that has evolved since its inception. I think theatre is a mode of expression, but the story does not end here; it starts here!By: Harshita Verma"

    "content": "Theatre has long been celebrated as a form of art that entertains, educates, and inspires. However, it is often overlooked as a means to promote peace and unity in society. As someone who has cherished theatre since childhood, I have witnessed its transformative power in bringing about inner peace and personal growth. Despite not pursuing acting professionally, my love of theatre has always been a guiding force in my life.The memories of my participation in nukkad natak, an Indian style of street theatre, serve as a constant reminder to me to speak up for what is right and to speak up for those who are unable to speak for themselves. When I am faced with personal struggles, I turn to the art of mono acting to convey my emotions and thoughts alone on stage, like a solo performer baring their soul to the audience. I can express my feelings and ideas without restraint when I perform, which gives me the confidence I need to face my worries and face the world on my own.Theatre, in all its various forms, has the power to bring peace and tranquilly to individuals. The process of preparing for a play or skit requires discipline, teamwork, and dedication—qualities that are essential for building a culture of peace where individuals work together towards one common goal. The theatre provides a safe space for people to express themselves and connect with others who share similar experiences. It offers a glimpse of hope for bridging gaps and advancing understanding in a world where conflicts and differences appear to be on the rise. It can also be a powerful tool for promoting social justice and addressing issues of inequality and injustice in society. By presenting stories and experiences of marginalised communities, theatre can raise awareness and promote empathy, understanding, and positive change. It can give voice to those who have been silenced and provide a platform for discussion. Not only this, but it also promotes intercultural understanding by sharing stories from all parts of the world. It can break down barriers and promote different cultures and ways of life.As we continue to explore the transformative power of theatre, let us embrace its ability to foster a culture of peace and harmony, one performance at a time.By: Dhairya Mishra"

    "content": "Ever since the 2015 Imtiaz Ali directorial, the perception of theatre in India has been altered to a metaphor.  An unfulfilled wish of the corporate naukar that he dreams of returning to after his early retirement. Here in 2023, I make an attempt to understand what makes theatre the voice of the trapped.In tamasha, baby Ved (Ranbir Kapoor) is mesmerized by the world of folktales and the charm of a Shimla storyteller. He reimagines mythological sagas in modern day and dreams of modelling the storyteller. But the quintessential mujhe padhai samajh nahi aati artsy child has a quintessential disapproving father. As he grows up, unhappy and unheard, he depends on a French island, a manic pixie dream girl and the Shimla storyteller to make sense of a confusing life. Until he realizes, kudos to the ‘I’ll fix him’ Tara (Deepika Padukone) that he’s not what he’s been told he is.Stories and storytelling are sought after as a means of escape from the monotony of the metropolitan- the tiring, the race, the pace. Theatre as an immersive art form of telling a tale includes both the performer and the audience. That misunderstood artist, that questions the way society works, inside a below-average product manager is given a purpose for that one-and-a-half-hour show.Outside of what we already have, a job and a regular 9-5 life, we need a story, maybe more. Preferably more. This adventure of telling a tale and being a part of it is represented by theatre and storytellers in Tamasha. In the film we see theatre, not just as a means to express who we really are inside but also to maintain peace.As Tara returns into Ved’s life, he begins to lose his sense of distinction between the Don in him, the hero who does what he wants, and his shell, a pre programmed robot. He loses the balance between his personalities and subsequently his job.So used to being told what to do next, Ved seeks the Shimla storyteller to tell him what will happen next in his story, his life. But the old roadside storyteller rebukes his cowardice, unknowingly pushing him to take his life in his own hands.Finally, it was only a resonating story that helped Ved convince his father of his dream.  It was a story that helped Ved meet Tara, make friends in a new town and ultimately pursue his passion. It was storytelling, theatre that connected the protagonist to his greater calling. Tamasha continues to be a cinephile’s favourite and has convinced many to get into that theatre workshop.As one recites stories to an audience, there’s hope to find oneself amongst all the characters played. Or just the tranquil of being someone other than whom you’re expected to be.By: Ananya Bansal"

    "content": "Theater is a type of performance art in which real actors or actresses perform in front of a live audience in a particular setting, frequently a stage, to portray the experience of a real or imagined event. The performers may use gesture, voice, song, music, and dance to convey this experience to the audience. Stagecraft and artistic elements like lighting and painted scenery are employed to make the experience more visceral, immediate, and present.This day is a celebration for those who can see the value and importance of the art form “theater”, and acts as a wake-up-call for governments, politicians and institutions which have not yet recognised its value to the people and to the individual and have not yet realized its potential for economic growthCHANAKYA NITI by Padama shri Manoj Joshi at Rugby auditorium, University of Delhi.Chanakya was the royal advisor to the Emperor, Chandragupta Maurya and wrote the Artha-Shastra (circa 2nd century BCE). He was a teacher, economist and jurist not a saint or a rishi. In his ‘niti’ are 6 verses which lead a person towards success by showing the right path. With** 1,039** performances of Chanakya, Joshi has become synonymous with the scholar-strategist who dared to dream of an integrated India - the one who created a political storm in Magadh (now Bihar) with his will, wisdom and words.‘HUMARI RIYA’ **by AAGHAAZ,** Kalindi College, University of DelhiA play based upon peer and parental pressure on a girl named Riya who aspires to be a writer but due to no support by parents chooses to study engineering unwillingly. In the due process of time she looses herself and her interest in everything which is reflected in her academics as she fails her exams. With the added pressure she falls prey for drugs as her friends influence and introduce her to drugs as a ‘stress buster’. As a result of the buildup of everything and witnessing her parents argue for her, Riya plans to take her own life. However, her mother intervenes just in time to prevent this from happening and helps Riya become herself once more.‘KHOL DO’ written by Sadat Hasan Manto and performed by** AAGHAAZ, Kalindi**Saadat Hasan Manto was a Pakistani writer, playwright and author born in Ludhiana, who was active in British India and later, after the 1947 partition of India, in Pakistan. He was tried several times for obscenity and was sentenced to 3 months imprisonment and 300 fines in Pakistan. Later, he was awarded the Highest Civilian award ‘Nishan-e-Imtiyaz’. Manto’s unabashed and brutal realism has shattered countless beliefs, creeds and concepts and has always dared to touch the flame of life with bare fingers. His story ‘khol do’ speaks about the time of partition and is placed in a refugee camp in mughalpura where a 17 year old daughter( Sakina) of Sirajuddin was separated from him while traveling from amritsar due to the riots. He describes her features to a group of boys and prays for their success in finding her. They locate the girl, but the old man only sees his daughter many days later, on a hospital stretcher, having been retrieved from a railway track. The doctor in charge asks him to open the windows—khol do—but response to the command comes from the half-conscious girl. Instinctively, her hands undo the knot of her trousers, and she pushes them down to her thighs, spreading her legs. The father rejoices—the girl is alive. But the doctor breaks into a sweat.In the end all I would say by quoting Shakespeare is, ”All the world’s a stage,And all the men and women merely players;They have their exits and their entrances;And one man in his time plays many parts,”By: Dhriti Khanna"

    "content": "Lights, sound effects, characters, audiences, storylines… aren’t these the things that strike our minds on hearing the word “theatre”? Isn’t it a thrilling experience to watch an interesting act? Well, theatre is not a very new phenomenon.It has been deeply rooted since very early times, though the form and techniques have changed a lot with the advancement of technology. The word is believed to have been derived from the Greek “theatron”, which means a place for viewing’. And as an art form, it is one of the most cherished all over the world, which not only is entertaining for the audience but at times communicates some strong messages.Tamasha of Maharashtra, UNESCO recognised Theyyam of Kerala, Nautanki, Bhavani of Western India, Saang of Rajasthan, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh—theatre in India is as diverse as the country itself and shares a strong bond with the cultural identity of the places. Often considered a mirror of society, its origin in the Indian context is rooted in mythology and has a wide description in ‘Natyashastra’. Earlier, theatres mostly comprised dance performances; often narrating a story with time, this unique world of art evolved and several additions followed. The role of ‘The Prithvi Theatre’ and ‘The Indian National Theatre’ is worth mentioning when it comes to the promotion of this art form in India.Though the traditional kind of theatre used to be entirely different from the present-day form (which is mostly Western-influenced with elements of indigenousness),there are a few theatre artists like Ravice Rashid, known as ‘Rayees Wathoon’, who have brought new dimensions and creativity to this form. The extraordinary fusion of Kashmir’s traditional folk theatre and the modern theatre was done by him and has earned him several awards, including the Ministry of Cultural Award and Jammu &amp; Kashmir Saqafit Markaz’s Young Personality Award. As a creative artist of ‘Bhand Pather’ art, he introduced modern elements to revive this art successfully while, at the same time, spreading awareness, about important issues like the RTI movement, sex abuse, and other important issues in collaboration with the J&amp;K government.Theatre activists like Dr. Brijeshwar Singh used theatre as a tool of social change, through his theatre repertoire, Rang Vinayak Rang Manch. A recipient of the Best Theatre Promoter Award by Rass Kala Manch and the Best Theatre Activist Award by Tagore Theatre, Dr. Singh has used theatre to raise awareness about social issues like gender discrimination, corruption, and communalism. A highly recommended trauma surgeon by profession, he is playing a prominent role in promoting this art form.It is said that art is needed to sustain a society. It is what fills emotions in an otherwise materialistic world. Realising the importance of this form of art, March 27 is observed as World Theatre Day to promote the theatre and encourage the people associated with it.By : Aditi Dandriyal"

One shouldn’t differentiate between all that breathes.”Saud and Nadeem, two brothers running a veterinary hospital for birds of prey out of the basement of their brick laden west Delhi family home along with their friend Salik navigate  the  fiscal  and  familial  difficulties  of  ‘saving  kites’ as the family business as more and more birds fall from the sky in Delhi’s worsening air, while a threat that has little to do with brotherhood or medicine begs whether they should be saving themselves instead.Similar in structural principle to _Eeb  Allay  Ooo!  _(2019, Prateek Vats), _All That Breathes _alternates from exquisite and beautiful shots of the city and its wildlife to the unpretentious, voyeuristic comedy of a middle class Delhi man’s everyday. The transitions and fills are lingering and gorgeous, making the most judicious and clever use of narration possible, collaging painstakingly personal, breathtaking moments of breath itself within the city with insights from two self made veterans of the same. Centipede breaking the surface of a puddle as an aeroplane flies overhead. Rats having a pixar dinner by a burst-gutter Sein. Cows migrating across a storm clogged river.  Flies  on a car deck.  Everything that breathes.Not a moment is wasted, not a single set half assed. The sound is withheld and haunting, it tells with what it doesn’t tell. The backdrop of the streets screams with protests and political agitation as Salik opens a refrigerator filled with meat. News headlines of the progression of violence over the CAA score the outline of themselves overlayed on shots of the streets and people. The whole film walks a circle around this violence; around prejudice and words. Only one section within the entire film even bothers stating violence, explicitly - not in as many words, but in pictures, and those too not of the violence itself, but of it’s aftermath. Of the space left behind by it, of the ashes left in its wake. It lasts for less than a minute. It is silent._“By calling people termites and rats, they’ve somehow made it about hygiene. Just like the kite’s different, people are also treated differently. Violence is al- ways an act of communication.”_2There is a term, for cinematic behaviour like this. Environmental story- telling. Telling a story not with what is there but with what is around it. ”What’s a crater?” ”A hole where something happened.”3 Every single one of the film’s 97 minutes is hand sculpted around this principle. Ultimately, _All That Breathes _is a film that chooses to be about the smaller picture. Cutout of empty space on the road, “what is a streetlight?” a streetlight is what is not there. It rejects the opportunity to say what it therefore ends up saying much more clearly; it is as much about Nadeem and Saud and what is left unsaid between them as the political commentary that it will end up being remem- bered for (one that it perhaps only makes incidentally). It is as much about the cost of doing something noble as it is about something noble perhaps not being enough. It is as much about the critters writhing in the dirt stuck underneath our fingernails as those blacklisted in the Citizenship Amendment Act. Some- times, all a parent can leave his child behind with is purpose. Perception can be a lineage, too, you know. _All That Breathes _is as much about why some men do what they do as it is about recognising that there is no reason for them to want to anymore than you and me. It dares you to recontinue the convenience of transferring the burden of care onto those that have the spine to carry it un-der the guise of acknowledging the goodness of their hearts. Of your miserable attempts to justify your apathy, your inaction, your gutlessness. It dares you to look a black kite in the eye from an inch away and not fall in love with it because it kills to eat.This is the worth of technical excellence; no labor of love is invisible. This film falls to me, within the unnervingly small category of perfect; deeply funny, deeply human, and absolutely flawless. It dares you to decide or admit that you’ve already decided - what is too dirty for you to mourn? What corpse are your hands too clean to pray for. What won’t you bury.What will you burn.By: Mouli Sharma"

    "content": "The health of our planet’s biodiversity and environment depends on wildlife. It encompasses a wide range of factors, such as ecological, economic, scientific, and cultural ones. But what fascinates me is symbolism and its enormous cultural relevance for several cultures and societies!Symbolism emerged in the late 19th century as a literary and artistic movement in response to the perceived limitations of realism, which was dominant at the time. Symbolist artists and writers used symbols, metaphors, and suggestions to explore the subjective, mystical, and subconscious aspects of human experience. They believed that art should elicit emotional responses from viewers. The inner world of an artist is more important than the external world, which simply depicts reality.Wildlife imbues symbolism in many cultures, religions, and belief systems. Many animals are called totems or spiritual guides, representing qualities people admire or aspire to possess. Let us see how depending on the culture, context, and individual interpretation, different animals represent a variety of things.**1. Freedom: **Birds associated with freedom and independence include eagles, hawks, and doves. Their ability to fly and soar through the skies symbolizes liberation and escape from the shackles of daily life. Eagles are frequently associated with power, freedom, and bravery. They also represent patriotism in some cultures.2. Strength: Animals like lions, tigers, and bears symbolize strength and power. Their predatory and fierce nature represents the ability to overcome obstacles and triumph over adversity. Dragons are commonly associated with strength and wisdom. In some cultures, it also represents good luck and fortune.**3. Wisdom: **Owls are often associated with wisdom and knowledge. Their nocturnal habits and piercing gaze indicate an ability to see beyond surface appearances and uncover hidden truths. Elephants are frequently associated with strength, wisdom, and longevity. They are also a symbol of good luck and prosperity in some cultures.4. Transformation: Butterflies are metaphors for transformation and metamorphosis. Their transformation from caterpillar to cocoon to butterfly is a powerful metaphor for personal growth and change. Snakes are usually associated with transformation, healing, and rebirth. In some cultures, they also represent temptation and danger. 5. Spirituality: Snakes are often associated with spiritual transformation and enlightenment. Their ability to shed their skin and emerge renewed and transformed symbolizes the soul’s journey toward greater understanding and enlightenment. Gentleness, grace, and innocence are frequently associated with deer. In some cultures, they are also a symbol of spiritual authority and leadership.**6. Intelligence: **Wolves are often associated with loyalty, intelligence, and teamwork. They also represent wilderness and nature in some cultures. Dolphins are frequently associated with playfulness, intelligence, and freedom. Some cultures regard them as symbols of harmony and peace.We must protect wildlife for future generations as it holds enormous cultural significance. It shall preserve biodiversity and ecosystems. It also sustains the cultural heritage of many communities. However, as symbols of the natural world and our place within it, animals and other creatures continue to hold a special place in human consciousness.-HARSHITA VERMA"

    "content": "World Wildlife Day is celebrated every year on March 3rd. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) proclaimed March 3rd as UN World Wildlife Day in 2013. This date was chosen because on March 3rd, 1973, CITES (the Convention On International Trade In Endangered Species Of Wild Fauna And Flora) came into force.SIGNIFICANCE OF WORLD WILDLIFE DAYOn this day, we celebrate the significance of the world’s flora and fauna in order to make this planet and our lives healthy. Many people are getting direct or indirect benefits from them. One in five people around the world rely on wild species for income and food, while 2.4 billion people depend on wood fuel for cooking.In this epoch, human-animal conflict has also been increasing due to the reduction in green belts; therefore, it’s a reminder of the urgent need to take initiatives for the conservation of biodiversity in order to balance the ecosystem. According to the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature), more than 42,100 species are threatened with extinction, which is 28% of all assessed species. The preservation of wildlife along with a minimalistic approach can stop the disruption of climatic change.THEME 2023: WILDLIFE CONSERVATION PARTNERSHIPThis year’s World Wildlife Day is very special as it coincides with the Golden Jubilee of CITES.The theme of the year is “Partnership for Wildlife Conservation,” which recognises the work of CITES and its collaboration for the conservation of wild fauna and flora that is going on around the globe.WHAT IS CITES?CITES (the Convention On International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) is an international agreement between governments. It’s aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species. Presently, 184 parties to the United Nations Charter abide by CITES regulations, and these countries have to implement legislation within their borders to enforce the CITES regulations. Currently, over 38,700 species, including roughly 5,950 species of animals and 32,800 species of plants, are protected by CITES against overexploitation through international trade.WORKING OF CITESCITES performs it’s work according to the appendices. There are three appendices that define the protection of wildlife in different categories.Appendix 1: It includes those species that are in danger of extinction due to international trade. Trade of the animals in this category is permitted only in exceptional circumstances, such as for research purposes. In this category, commercial trade is prohibited. For example, Asian lions and tigers.Appendix 2: It includes species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction but for which trade must be controlled in order to avoid exploitation incompatible with their survival. For example, American alligators.Appendix 3: It includes species that are protected in at least one country, and that country asked another CITES party for assistance in controlling the trade.IS CITES SUCCESSFUL ?CITES is the international organisation that provides the framework for the international trade of wildlife, but it still has many loopholes. One such is that CITES can impose sanctions if a party violates the legislation at the international level, but CITES has no application to domestic markets or wildlife trafficking occurring within states. Another problem is that CITES membership is voluntary, so countries don’t accept sanctions very often and quit the membership. It doesn’t protect even a huge number of animals in the wildlife trade, especially those who are not enlisted in any of the three appendices. For example, only 8 percent of the world’s known reptiles are listed in the appendices, while it’s reported that the skins of many of the non-listed reptiles are traded. The listing of species in annexes is highly driven by politics rather than scientific process. But there are some activities done by CITES that are worthy of mentioning, such as the protection of tortoises and freshwater turtles from illegal trade.Kim Shotola wrote in her book, “The Soul Watchers: A Quest to Awaken Humanity,”“Animals are a window to your soul and a doorway to your spiritual destiny.” If you let them into your life and allow them to teach you, you will be better for it.So it’s a time for us to be close to wildlife and nature. Nature has enough to satisfy our needs, but true greed knows no limits. So we have to not only think about human beings, but we must also think collectively about our mother planet, and we must establish an ecosystem where no organism’s life can be threatened due to human greed. (Picture credit:- un.org)By: Shilpi Kumari"

    "content": "Every year, March 8 is celebrated worldwide as International Women’s Day. An attempt to celebrate gender equality and to provide a platform to appreciate the social, economic, and political achievements of women, Women’s Day holds good significance in society. However, despite such efforts to give special importance to the female gender, a much-heated topic nowadays is centered around the need for feminism.Women have been subjugated to helplessness and a lack of freedom for centuries. They are often viewed as objects more than humans and are looked upon as “perfect notions of beauty without brains,” justifying their secluded lives within the house’s four walls. What people often overlook is the fact that women also deserve an equal amount of respect and fame as is enjoyed by men today. Rooted in this idea, often described as the other “F” word, “feminism,” is a very contemporary yet debatable issue.The driving force behind Feminism often confuses the viewers and readers on the need for Feminism: “Why do we need Feminism?” Well, the answer lies in the word itself: women’s empowerment: to create a world where gender differences blur out and the rule of men and women supersedes. Another significant reason is to provide women with a platform and a chance to step out of the fetters of patriarchy and explore their true selves without being judged. To increase the participation of women in the political framework, granting them voting rights also comes under the definition of feminism. Since the ratio of literacy among boys and girls is quite shallow, the idea of feminism aims to combat all such contrasts by not just providing equal rights but also an opportunity for the female community to access those rights.Given the degraded history of women, feminists across the world demand a healthy living environment for females to create an atmosphere of equality in every field despite gender barriers. Movements like #metoo have helped strengthen the spirit of feminism and shed light on shady activities happening across industries worldwide. This has also led to reformations in work policies and expanded the attention and inclusivity of the movement, considering various factors like race, caste, sexuality, and religion.Another crucial factor is violence against women, which is a pressing issue around the globe. An astounding statistic from 2016 shows that four cases of rape are reported every hour in India. Another survey ranks India as the most unsafe country for women, depending on numerous parameters like healthcare, cultural and traditional practices, economic resources, violence (sexual and non-sexual), female foeticide and infanticide, and human trafficking.Therefore, there is an unquestionable need for feminism, as it is an important movement in current times.By: Vanya JainFeatured Image Credits: _Team Attorneylex _"

    "content": "On 8 march 1914, the arrest of Sylvia Pankhurst is the escapade that paved the way for the celebration of International women’s day. To say, it has been over a century since the incident occurred, and the consolation that we get to this day is that at least ‘things are changing’. So let us talk about these institutions and the generation that is the ‘flag bearer’ of this change.I am a regular going student college at Kalindi College, an institution that takes great pride in calling itself an all-women’s institution. It is almost daily that we are given lessons on feminist studies, studying the intricacies of different thinkers on women’s psyche and the history of long struggles. It is empowering in a sense, seeing women around you grow and finally given the ground which we rightfully deserve. With the long backing history of people relinquishing their skins to form the way that we trod today, one can expect these ‘modern institutions’ to be the change maker. But what hope does one have left when you see them opening the gates we all tried so hard to close?My friend was on her period and went to take a pad from the school infirmary wherein we were expected a fee of 5 rupees for the napkin. The incident was stupefying in a way. It is not about the mere amount that you pay but the very existence of a fee to buy a product that has the sole role of hygiene. The situation is not any different at other places either. Incidents like this pose the question of your very existence, we are expected to pay for something which is out of our area of authority. The worsening of the situation dates back to 1994 when the pink tax was brought on the spectrum. The doubled cost for the products directed towards the feminine audience is so normalized in the market.The fight is undoubtedly a long and demanding one, but it is incident like these that makes one question whether to are we really trying.

    "content": "Happy International Women’s Day!To celebrate every woman and cherish their existence, I interviewed a government officer to learn how women helped him be a successful person in his life.Interviewer: Why do you think that it is important to celebrate Women’s Day?It is very important to celebrate Women’s Day, but I don’t think there should be a specific date or day to do so. Every day must be celebrated to empower women, to appreciate women, to encourage others to respect women, and to give importance to women in our lives.Interviewer: “Behind every successful man is a strong woman.” So, who is the strong woman that encourages you in your life?My mom is the strongest person in my life. We have a holiday every week, but she can’t even have a single holiday in her whole life. She is the biggest support system who encouraged me to take life decisions on my own. She was with me when throughout my failed attempts. She was the only one who encouraged me and where I am today in my life is only because of her.Interviewer: “Women are giving their best in every field of sports, education, fashion, and entrepreneurship.” Is there any inspiring story of a woman that motivates you in your life?Every woman’s story motivates me. One such story is that of my nani. In her childhood days, an attempt was made by her mother to kill her just because she was a daughter and they had to pay a dowry in her future marriage. But somehow she managed to survive with the help of her father. And after that, she became a respectable doctor with her hard work!Interviewer: It is said, “If you educate a man, you educate an individual, but if you educate a woman, you educate a society.” Do you see any sort of changes brought in by educating women as compared to ancient times?Educating women helps to build a thoughtful society. Through educated women, small families are prospering. In ancient times, education was not easily accessible to all women. But we do have many examples where women lead society in certain states and are successfully thriving. Women have a good bargaining capacity, and in politics, they can do good for our nation.Interviewer: What is women’s empowerment according to you?According to me, giving them the freedom to do whatever they want and not stopping them to achieve their dreams. Each woman has the capability to work hard and inspire the world.By: Ayushi AroraInterviewee: Gaurav Arora"

    "content": "As the winter season is approaching towards the end, I had a candid conversation with one of my neighbor (A Geography teacher) who gave me some valuable insights and knowledge about the upcoming spring season.Interviewer: Can you tell us a little bit about the spring season?“Spring is one of the four seasons in the temperate zones. It is the transition period from winter to summer and is characterized by longer days, warmer weather, and the emergence of new growth in plants and animals.”Interviewer: What are some of the typical weather patterns during the spring season?“The weather during spring can be quite varied, depending on the region. In many parts of the world, spring is characterized by mild temperatures, occasional rain showers, and the occasional thunderstorm. In some areas, spring can be quite chilly, with snow still on the ground, while in others, it can be quite warm, with temperatures reaching into the 80s or even 90s.”Interviewer: What are some of the most iconic symbols or events associated with spring?“Some of the most iconic symbols of spring include flowers blooming, trees budding, and baby animals being born. Spring is also a time for many religious and cultural celebrations, such as Easter, Passover, and Holi. Many people also associate spring with spring cleaning, which involves de-cluttering and organizing one’s home.”Interviewer: How do the arrival of spring impact people’s moods and behavior?“For many people, the arrival of spring is a time of renewal and rejuvenation. The longer days and warmer weather can lead to increased energy and motivation, while the emergence of new growth can create a sense of hope and optimism. Many people also experience a reduction in Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) symptoms, which can cause depression during winter.”Interviewer: Are there any challenges or drawbacks to the spring season?“While spring is generally a pleasant and enjoyable season, it can also bring some challenges. For example, seasonal allergies can be a problem for many people, as the pollen from blooming plants can trigger symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and itchy eyes. Spring can also bring the risk of severe weather, such as tornadoes and thunderstorms, which can cause damage and disruption.”Interviewer: Overall, what do you think makes the spring season unique and special?“I think what makes spring unique and special is the sense of new beginnings that it brings. After the long, dark days of winter, the emergence of new growth and warmer weather can create a sense of hope and optimism for the future. Spring is a time for renewal, for cleaning out the old and bringing in the new, and for celebrating the beauty of life and growth.”Srishti Singh"

    "content": "Published in 1944 under the pseudonym Mary Westmacott, “Absent in the Spring” is a book by Agatha Christie. The title has been taken from William Shakespeare’s sonnet 98, “From you have I been absent in the spring” . The significance of spring is not being able to enjoy the blooming season when a loved one is not there. In contrast to her well-known detective stories, this book offers a psychological exploration of Joan Scudamore, a woman who finds herself left alone in the desert and forced to face her actual nature.In the 1940s, a middle-aged woman named Joan Scudamore makes a solo trip from Baghdad to Kirkuk to visit her husband, who works for an oil company. She is stranded in her home for a few days because of a sudden sandstorm, and during that time, she starts to think back on her relationships and life. She learns that she has been so preoccupied with trying to satisfy other people and fit in with social norms that she has lost sight of her own wants and individuality. Joan comes to the realization that she has been portraying a fake self to everyone, even her own family, and has been living a lie. When she starts to accept who she really is, Joan’s epiphany is both upsetting and empowering.The book is exquisitely written and displays Christie’s talent for telling tales. It digs into the intricacies of interpersonal interactions and the challenges of comprehending one’s own emotions and intentions. Readers will identify with Joan’s complex and likable character as she attempts to understand her inner conflicts.In conclusion, “Absent in the Spring” is a challenging and touching book that differs from Christie’s typical detective stories yet is no less engrossing. For admirers of Christie’s writing and anyone interested in learning more about the human condition, it is a must-read.Rashi AkankshaFeatured Image Credits: Wikepedia"

    "content": "Just after the chilly winter season, spring is the season when the natural universe revives and regenerates. Plants that have been inert for a while begin to grow once more in the spring &amp; animals that have been hibernating come out of their slumber.The astronomical definition of the term determines what most people refer to as spring. Astronomical spring is determined by the tilt of the Earth toward the sun and also by equinoxes and solstices. The time between the spring equinox and the summer solstice is typically referred to as spring. Also known as the vernal equinox, it takes place around March 20 in the Northern Hemisphere and around September 22 in the Southern Hemisphere.According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Spring is one of the two seasons when the Earth’s axis is not pointing either toward or away from the sun . The summer solstice, which takes place around June 21, is when the North Pole in the Northern Hemisphere is tilted at its largest angle toward the sun. On December 21, the South Pole gets closer to the Southern Hemisphere. As a result, astronomical spring spans March 21 and June 21 in the Northern Hemisphere and September 21 and December 21 in the Southern Hemisphere, date and time may differ slightly from year to year.However, the air may warm up before the middle of March or September. Climatological Spring is a three period marked by rising temperatures, according to meteorologists. As per NOAA, meteorological Spring occurs in the Northern Hemisphere during the months of September, then in March, April, and May. Whereas it occurs in the South Hemisphere in October and November. Temperatures rise in the hemisphere which is inclined more towards the sun. The ground may have frozen over the winter, but as the temperature rises, it becomes lighter and much more pliable to trees and shrubs. The amount of rain appears to rise in spring, which also works to help water young seedlings that are taking shape inside the soil.Animals that hibernate through the cold weather emerge from their lairs left for warmer climates to come back. In the spring, numerous creatures give birth. Those who wore winter coats shed them, and some animals may change their color to fit in with their new environment. And although rivers are overrun by melted snow during the spring, flooding may become more common. As warm moist air from the equator mixes with still-cold air much further north or south, Spring may indeed bring typhoons.Everything on Earth serves a useful purpose in the changing of the seasons; they provide us with sunshine, water, and so much more. Currently, climate change is impacting our seasons, leading to severe storms, rise in Sea levels and melting of glaciers that harms not only our society and way of life but also the natural world. Hence, there is a need to stop all the practices which are harmful to our environment and accept the natural changes as they are.BY MEENAKSHI"

    "content": "New Delhi: The 9th of February kicked off the annual NCC fest of Delhi University’s old, prestigious, big named alumnus heavy Kirori Mal College. Boys and girls in combat uniforms with 5kg Aashirvad Aatta equivalent dummies carried out the section attack on the front lawns (“arrowhead formation” “classic”) as a crowd consisting of 30 person teams along with their moral supporters of over 23 institutions (including those from outside of the directorate) surrounded the grounds looking anywhere but at them.Culture finds a way.It is a reasonable claim to make - all be it still a claim - that it is ultimately not alienation or ignorance but familiarity that breeds apathy. An observation that at the end of the day seemed more worthwhile a subject to write down this piece of pseudo news about than any number of lackluster open ground concerts where the noise is too loud, the food stalls too desperate and the number on the cheque cashed by the artist too too long was simply this: the world is recursive. Arvind Kejriwal used a phrase in his speech at the Directorate General of NCC on the 8th of January at this year’s CM Visit for the Republic Day celebrations: “[] a microcosm of the country.” But a national integration camp is not what is a microcosm and our nation is not what it is a microcosm of._The world is recursive. _Society recreates itself within itself, and whether it be an unmoving resilience of the human spirit or a biological vulnerability to the goddamn act of bleating, a man will create tradition where he cannot find it, if only so he has something to get used to.The various niches of DU Fests - departmental, ECA, NCC, NSS, what have you - are a case study in self-sustaining ecosystems. A ”normal” person walking into the gates of CADET’23 (excellent name, by the way, truly an epitome of the spirit of originality and creativity the military and modern education are so insistent upon inculcating) will find certain sights to gaze upon. Goats in a petting zoo. Infiltrators in a cult. Look how they greet each other, arms a stiff set by their sides, white lie caressing their lips (“Jai Hind everyone”). Look what they care about, creases on their pants and 3 buttons over their waists. Look how they think; they don’t.Somewhere past the point of no return of zoning out on the rifles aimed directly between my eyes as the section attack droned on, my friend had thrust a green piece of sponge and a white bottle of shoeshine into my hands. Multi purpose polish, that’s what she’d called it.“What, seriously?”“Seriously.”“Fuck off.”She’d just given me a look, then took the polish back and started brute forcing the last of it out onto the sponge. I rolled my eyes and moved to a ledge nearby, waving her to come over. The front crease of the uniform is as delicate as it is permanent. You can’t be bending over in half 30 minutes from your inspection, and a shoe has to shine. Unfortunately for her, by the time she’d managed to get millimeter of her multi purpose polish out onto her flimsy dish sponge and walk over to me another of her subordinates had beat her to it (you shine one guy’s shoes, you shine the whole squad’s). One who had several complaints to make about my shoe shining skills.“Maybe just polish it yourself then. She’s doing it isn’t she?”“Yeah I’m doing it, just shut the fuck up.”“That’s enough! I’ll do it,” said my friend. Owner of and first in line for the polish, and incidentally, the Junior Under Officer of our company. The senior most in our batch.“No, you can’t,” the whiner said. Took her shoe off the ledge.“Put it back up.”“Please don’t.”“What did I say?”For the life of that dying bottle, dear old JUO managed to polish every single one of those 9 pairs of drill march shoes, some better than others. She stood there frowning beside me after the formality of brushing a dry sponge over her own shoes, and wordlessly handed her precious materials back over to me.“This is pretty wet,” I’d said then. Silence.“Probably still has a substantial amount of polish in it.” I lent over and pressed the last dredges of multi purpose shoeshine onto her dust covered boots. Best I could.“It works on normal shoes too.”“That’s nice.”“I said, it works on normal shoes too.”I looked up at her and her eyes moved down to my shoes and back to me. She raised an eyebrow. I rolled my eyes and pressed the sponge down on my own no longer black sport shoes. She smiled.“See?”“I do.”“It’s useful, isn’t it.”“They don’t need polish, dude they need a turbo wash.”“Yeah, but if you polished them you wouldn’t have to turbo wash them.”I gave her a look. She smiled.There is a certain isomorphism to self-contained social subsystems that will go over the head of anyone lost to the great big symbolism of the shoe. A good leader in an NCC fest leading a squad drill team is the same as one in a hackathon is the same as one in band is the same as the one on the council, even if their languages don’t translate. Did you go to school with the same people you met at college? Are you working with the same people you sit with at dinner? Do you want to?You move past the arrogance of believing yourself to be more than the common American idiot and you’ll realize that the eccentricities you find voyeurising the unbent knees and the abdominal cry of a military squad are just variants of your own. You are guilty of worship, you’ve just given your god a different name. You are the cult and you are the petting zoo. Your normalcy is an illusion.The best you can hope for in life is people you’d douse your sport shoes in wax for. A multipurpose polish that works on all kinds of shoes. A dummy rifle that slaps back. A tug of war rope that isn’t long enough. Good fest or bad fest because everything everyone everywhere is the same. The best you can hope for is to find something you cannot predict.By: Mouli Sharma"

    "content": "Image Source:  wondriumdaily.comEMBRACING EMOTIONS… All of them. “Life is like a roller-coaster ride, you’ll experience all kinds of highs and lows.” By this time, we all know this and have accepted this in some way or the other, maybe while speaking to ourselves in solitude or while consoling our loved ones during their hard times. But do all of us accept it the same way as we expect others to do when we console them or even ourselves? There are many moments, moments which bring a lot of happiness, some which bring a lot of sadness, some make us feel very loved, and some are just too painful to handle.. but is our treatment the same for all of them? While we welcome the emotions of happiness, cheerfulness, and love and celebrate them.. most of us refuse to accept moments that bring pain, which manage to bring tears out of our eyes and let alone talk about them to others. But the question is.. why not welcome and celebrate all of them? I mean I know, celebrating pain sounds ridiculous, but it is just as important. As far as I have experienced (in the 18 years of my life), handling pain and sadness are horrible, but it makes one a stronger person. Sadness, pain, anger, jealousy, and all the other emotions which are termed “negative”, sometimes, manage to teach us a lot more than positive emotions do. They make us a stronger, more mature, and more experienced person. So the point here is to affirm that it is perfectly okay to feel all the emotions. One day we might feel happy, another day we might feel grumpy and sad, with a reason or without a reason, but rather than sitting, contemplating, and overthinking them and the whole life, we can make the best out of all the emotions by accepting them. Accepting that, “yes, I am feeling sad.. I don’t know the reason.. but yeah I am just sad..”, can make a HUGE difference, for sure. Embracing it would make you feel like you are aware of yourself, and know who you are, what are your likes, what are your dislikes, etc. Embrace all of them, if you feel happy, accept that you are feeling happy. If you are sad, accept that you are feeling sad. Just a simple gesture like this will make you feel like you can hang in there if it’s a tough situation, and if it’s a happy situation, it will make you feel even happier. Good luck with Embracing all emotions!BY R.Lakshmi Priya"

    "content": "When allowed to speak, Kiara Advani delivers an outstanding performance. The story begins with the investigation tape and the upcoming DU Fests, and it takes place at the famous St. Martin’s College. The three major protagonists in the film are NANKI (Kiara Advani), TANU SHARMA (Akansha Ranjan Kapoor), and VJ Pratap (Gurfateh Singh Pirzada). The plot revolves around the band of St Martin’s College, which includes Nanki, the lyricist, VJ Pratap, the main vocalist, and Hardy, KP, and Tashi. This Ruchi Narain-directed film mostly follows Nanki’s point of view as it progresses. Tanu Kumar, a classmate, is accused of being raped by VJ Pratap. A Dhanbad native is renowned for her flashy clothing and hostel brawls. VJ is the college crowd’s favorite. A well-built man who is the son of a politician and is dating Nanki, the sexiest girl in college. The evolution of the characters gives the film an excellent appearance. Tanu, for example, is portrayed as a want-to-be cool girl who is continuously seeking VJ. This is the most difficult aspect for people to judge whether her allegation is correct. Nanki, who is frequently seen standing by VJ, later withdraws and worries if he is guilty. This gives you hope that a solid crime drama will emerge, keeping you interested until the very end. Because of the several stories and competing points of view, one is urged to conclude.Photo **source : **FirstpostThis film illustrates the rise of social media and how it is impacting professions, as shown in the conversion of two attorneys dealing with the case of VJ Pratap. When lawyers Mirchandani and Danish Ali were discussing the case. Tanu is an attention seeker, and VJ Pratap is well-known and has a girlfriend, so why would he do such a thing? She simply wants money because he is affluent, and if two people are having sex in the same room, it is consenting sex, not rape. Guilty emphasizes these present anxieties that a girl is experiencing. The majority of the story is told in flashbacks while Danish (Taher Shabbir), a lawyer, interrogates witnesses such as friends, bandmates, and passersby. Nanki is also torn between her lover, who claims the sex was consensual and a result of intoxication, and his accuser, who uses social media to mobilize a #MeToo movement and make newspaper headlines. Guilty is a reaction to the rise and fall of the MeToo movement. It addresses issues like oppression, power, sexism, gender dynamics, class discrepancies, prejudice, and, of course, guilt.Overall, “Guilty” is a well-crafted film that compellingly handles important issues. The emotional thrust is provided by Kiara Advani, who portrays the unhappy youngster who is limited by upbringing, misplaced values, and remorse. She saves the film when the verbose climax succumbs to the pull of evangelism. Guilty ends up talking at us rather than engaging in conversation. Fortunately, what is being said is necessary to hear. The Delhi backdrop is shown well in the film. As the film is set up with the Me Too movement, how serious things can get is shown well in the film. The BGM, production values, and visuals are good.BY AVANTIKA RANA"

    "content": "“Take pride in how far you have come. Have faith in how far you can go but don’t forget to enjoy the journey. “-**Michael Josephson **With each upcoming year the Colleges of Delhi University and other Universities host many enthralling fests with intriguing events, concerts of big stars, diverse college societies, exciting cash prices for winners and so much more! They provide a performative platform for recognising varied talents of numerous college students. The fests are one of a kind, as soon the season begins it gets people talking about its liveliness. It’s a place where anyone can find something or the other for them. You can find lip smacking food stalls,  fun games stalls and stalls to buy goods or books. Moreover, they are a part of one’s unforgettable experience because of the famous battle of bands, musical concerts, intense debates, creative filmmaking and energetic dance face offs, etc.Hearing from the your mates : “College fests are in general the best way , in my opinion, to connect people from different areas. DU fests, are free for DU students and provide definite entertainment and information, be it a concert, games, talk shows, etc. Also there are various stalls in the interest of distinct things where we can even purchase things, games we will definitely have fun playing, plus the most important thing which is communication and interaction which I think is the most interesting product of these fests.” - Samarth (Student, Delhi University)Well, it is not at all surprising that college fests are for sure an amazing part of college life experiences as we students eagerly await for them until the next edition arrives. But wait, what about the other side ? I mean everything has its positives and negatives then how can fests be spared. You all must have heard shocking stories about DU fests and other Universities that had made their space in the headlines of various newspapers and e-newspapers. Plenty of incidents of stamping, improper management, groping and cat-calling are witnessed which impacts the minds of young masses. Authorities are taking actions but still there is a need to ensure proper safety with stern measures as an immediate matter of concern!Flipping the coin for you to see through the other side : “People show talent, dance on the same tunes and have fun together but I think there are many negatives too, especially what I felt in my college fest people were drunk the security wasn’t that tight it was a chaos and all. It’s understandable that controlling people in college is hard but at least there should be proper management.” - Hamdan (Student, other University) “I recall a fest where the concert of a popular singer was about to start and people were entering the college campus by hopping from the walls and gates. Suddenly the crowd grew so huge that the situation was uncontrollable by the police officials as well. Moreover, there was a network issue in the area which infused a sense of panic. Till now, this incident makes me think twice before going to any fest!” - Harshita (Student, Delhi University).In the era of getting information about different fests with a jet speed through social media also comes the FOMO. Ah, indeed a major factor for our choices! Fun and frolics all around also brings foreboding. After all, Just enjoy and be safe. I’m sure you all would definitely not miss this fest season as it is here for a good reason.BY HARSHITA VERMA"

    "content": "“Cancel Culture” in a layman language means the idea of taking away support for an individual, career and their popularity because of something they’ve said or done that is considered unacceptable in the society. Many times big celebrities or other people associated with Indian industry have experienced the phase of “being cancelled” because they are a public figure with influence over huge audience and what they’ve done or said is alleged to have caused harm to a person or group of community. The practice of “ cancel culture” can be traced back to #metoomovement started in USA, where many people cancelled or boycotted the famous celebrities who were accused of sexual misconduct.“Cancel culture” has been a worldwide phenomenon, and it’s not just faced by sections of people. People on social media can cancel anything and everything, from a joke to celebs if they don’t like the theme or idea linked to what the film or celebrity is depicting. By doing multiple films a year, stars create many employment opportunities, ultimately boosting the country’s economy. Now the question that arises is, “Is boycotting a whole movie because of a single person/incident a justified option?” There have been many instances provoking the Boycott Trend in Bollywood. From Aamir’s comment on intolerance to Akshay’s citizenship controversies, we’ve seen netizens bursting out their anger in the form of cancelling celebs.This year, in particular, has been harsh on the industry as it not only saw the crushing failure of almost all its big celebrities: From Amir khan’s Laal Singh Chaddha, Ranbir Kapoor’s Shamshera to all three of Akshay kumar films – Bachchhan Paandey, Samrat Prithviraj and Raksha Bandhan.One of the incident happened in 2015 wherein big celebs like Shahrukh khan and Akshay kumar got trolled due to their comment on rising intolerance in the country. However, Shahrukh khan managed to glide his Dilwale–which released just a month after his comments to nearly Rs 140 crore despite poor reviews and clash with a superior film, Bajirao Mastani.But industry’s course took a turn for the worse in 2020, when actor Sushant Singh Rajput was found dead at his home. His sudden demise gave birth to numerous conspiracy theories, vicious media coverage, rampant misinformation that put members of the Hindi film industry directly under attack. They were labelled drug addicts, murderers and anti- nationals. As a result, people who got targeted had been trolled in the social media and their career got a huge break.After frequent closing of cinema halls due to multiple Covid waves in two years, when films started releasing consecutively, they faced the ‘anti-Bollywood’ sentiment, which was formed in 2020. There was hate against Akshay Kumar’s Sooryavanshi as it was by Karan Johar, who was blamed to admit only the star kids in the industry and crushing the dreams and aspiration of the unsung actors.Not only box office films face public backlash but also web series films faced the same conflicts like Huma Qureshi film ‘Leila’ was targeted for allegedly promoting ‘Hindu Phobia’. In 2020, Deepika Padukone starrer ‘_Chhapaak’, _a story of an acid attack survivor faced severe backlash and was boycotted in many states not because of any objectionable content but simply because the lead actress had shown solidarity with anti-CAA protestors at the time. The actress was also subjected to rape and death threats.Even though the cancel or boycott campaigns are aimed to knock down any commercial success of a movie or series, more often than not it has had the opposite effect as these controversies generate curiosity and that curiosity often transforms into success which we have seen in films like GANGUBAI KATHIAWADI, DANGAL, PATHAN, PADMAVATI etc.al. Even this happened in Ali Fazal and Pankaj Tripathi web series MIRZAPUR. After the success of the first season the series was all set to launch its second season in October 2020, however due to the lead actor Ali Fazal’s anti–CAA speech many right wingers demanded to cancel the series and #BoycottMirzapur started trending on twitter. However, season 2 of the series created history by becoming the most-watched show on Amazon Prime in India within just seven days of its release.Boycotting cancel culture can create a huge impact on lives of people as when a person comments on public figure about a particular situation, those are his/her personal views but can destroy the image of celebrity figure. Boycotting someone for their personal view is not right as the film is made with everyone equal effort and hard work so a glide of any film due to controversies can lead to crushing down those people time and effort. Social media users must check fact before posing their personal opinion, no user should attack on any public figure when they express their take on an issue no matter it is about their personal or social life. Everyone wants to be rich and famous, and if someone manages to reach that position after so much hard work (even with the help of family or connections, if nepotism is involved) it’s not fair to overlook their hard work and bash them for their achievement.“WE SHOULD NEVER IMPOSE HARSH COMMENTS ON ANY PUBLIC FIGURE AS IT CAN DESTROY THEIR CAREER AND PERSONAL LIFE. IF INDIAN CONSTITUTION HAS GIVEN US THE RIGHT TO EXPRESSION SO WE MUST RESPECT IT WITHOUT DESTROYING ITS CREDIBILITY.”Featured Image Credits: Outlook IndiaNandini Khera"

    "content": "Pathaan, an adventurous action film that tends to play to the crowd and souls up to the hype,is something of an event movie as it marks Shah Rukh Khan’s comeback to the big screenafter a prolonged absence of 4 years. The story revolves around India’s decision to revokeArticle 370 (the privileged status of J&amp;k) and how much it affects a Pakistani official whodemands compensation from India for its “mistake.”When the general gets to know about his cancer &amp; he has only 3 years, he reaches out to anex-Raw agent i.e. Jim who was treated unfairly by his people. He is assisted by his seductivecorrespondence with Rubai, a former ISI agent played by Deepika Padukone, who hasmurky motivations. As they move between continents and engage in a risky game oftreachery and retaliation, Pathaan, Jim, and Rubai lock horns and lock eyes. The threecompete to obliterate and defend the worlds they hold dearIn his spy thriller, director Siddharth Anand goes overboard. He approaches it as some kindof superhero film that requires a great deal of believability. Here, it is clear that he isfascinated by and worships mainstream Hollywood blockbusters like the Mission Impossiblefilms starring Tom Cruise and the Marvel movies. Expect a femme fatale, a wingsuit a laFalcon, heightened action and chase scenes, death-defying stunts on cars, bikes, ice, andhelicopters, immortal heroes and villains mouthing sharp dialogue, and all of this drenched inthe idea of patriotism.For a large portion of the movie, the focus is on the action rather than the sentiments, whichis new ground for Shah rukh khan, who is best known for his romance or interactive roles. Itis fascinating how, at 57, he still portrays himself as a full-fledged action hero, letting hisbody and those intensely expressive eyes do the conversation. His existence saves amediocre storyline &amp; poor visual effects. Vishal &amp; Shekhar’s music for the movie succeeds inreflecting courage and bravado on screen, even though background music does not feelaligned with the incidents.The standout aspect of Pathaan is indeed John Abraham’s excellent Jim performance. Johnis fearsome and presents a perfect demonstration of the antagonist partially overpoweringthe protagonist, whether it’s through his Bane-like cloaked entrance or stunt scenes.Although Deepika Padukone is a badass and is flawlessly cast as the obedient, ethicallyambiguous, willowy agent, their chemistry makes it feel immature. It doesn’t have the sameenergy that John-SRK’s characterized. Once more pulling a Core principle, Dimple Kapadiagives the events the necessary credence and emotional depth.Featured Image Credits: Bollywood HumgamaMeenakshi"

I interviewed 4 people together from Delhi to gather their views on this.1. Do you watch movies? What was the last bollywood movie you watched ?A- Yes, I love watching movies the last movie I watched was Pathaan.B- Ofcourse, the last movie I watched was king Khan’s movie.C- Sometimes. The last was Pathaan, my kids and husband wanted to watch it.D - I do but only the one which are in talks. Last was Pathaan.2. So since all of you have watched Pathaan, did you like it? The actors and everything?A- Yes I loved it. I loved SRK and John was looking really hot.B- YES. I am a big fan of shahrukh sir I loved him. And Deepika looked really good. I even stayed till the end of the movie to enjoy the ‘jhoome jo pathaan’ wala gaana. King is finally back!C - It was good. Loved the salman bhai’s cameo. My kids were shouting when he came.D- Theek thi. I felt the movie was a mixture of war and krish series. After a really long time SRK’s movie came so yeah good in that case.3. Pathaan was also getting boycotted before its release what are your views on that?A- Yeah the news was really weird. Without any solid reason people started boycotting the movie. A lot of work, money and time goes into it how can one even say that? ki boycott krdoB- Media needs to be blamed for this. They started pointing out Deepika’s “orange” Bikini and the next day it became a huge news. And people who have no work just waste time started #boycott on Twitter. In the past as well heroines have worn bikinis but nothing was a problem then but now it is? It doesn’t make any sense.C - yeah I heard the news. It was total nonsense. I have no words to say for this.D- Yeah to be honest, that was the reason I wanted to watch the movie. I was like there’s nothing wrong with the trailer or songs but still it’s on this stupid boycott trend so why not let’s watch it.4. Do you support this boycott culture which has now become a trend in Bollywood?A - no not at all. I love watching movies. And if you notice this boycott trend is started by foolish people who have no idea about anything.B- No. All of this starts from Twitter and I’m not on Twitter so obviously I don’t support this trend (laughs). I don’t understand in the first place why the movies get boycotted it also happened with padmaavat and Brahmastra. With pathaan I think some politics is also included regarding srk and his son’s arrest.C- Yeah I agree with him (B person) I also think it has something to do with Aryan’s Arrest maybe some kind of planning and all was done to boycott pathaan cause srk himself was also the producer. Although I don’t agree with any of this because personal life is different and professional is different.D- As I told you I went to watch the movie because of this boycott thing only. But the reasons why it was getting boycotted were really stupid and not just pathaan movie got boycotted but just because of their names, like lakshmi and padmaavat were too and it made no sense. Also, I think people have become more sensitive. Anyways, answer to your question would be no I don’t support this trend.Featured Image Credits: News BharatiSomya Bhaskar"

    "content": "“A flag not only of freedom for ourselves but a symbol of freedom to all the people”  Jawaharlal Nehru [Late Prime Minister of India]A flag is an important element of every country in acting as a symbol of the country’s freedom and pride. It provides an individualistic identity to the country and brings its people together.India’s tri-color or ‘tiranga’, too, is an emblem of our nation’s integrity, sovereignty, and freedom. It symbolizes the values, beliefs, and history of the nation while also providing a sense of belonging to the community. It evokes feelings of patriotism, unity, and pride, values that are integral to maintaining the strength of a nation.As Rome was not built in a day, our ‘Tiranga’ too is a result of the constant evolvement of ideas, designs, and thoughts. It is a result of years of collaborative efforts and contributions by the leaders and the youth of the country.The evolution of the Indian Flag commenced in 1906 when the first national flag was hoisted in the Parsee Bagan Square in Calcutta (now Kolkata) on August 7. This flag’s design consisted of three horizontal strips of red, yellow, and green colors.Further in 1907, a flag of a similar design with a few changes was raised by Bhikaiji Cama in Paris. This also came to be known as the ‘ Berlin Committee Flag ‘ due to its exhibition at a socialist conference in Berlin.1917 was the year when the third Indian flag made its appearance. It was hoisted during the Home Rule Movement by Dr. Annie Besant and Lokmanya Tilak. The design of this flag was such that it had four green horizontal strips arranged alternately, with seven stars in the saptarishi configuration superimposed on them. In the top, left corner lay the Union, Jack. There was also a white crescent and star in one corner. This flag was indicative of autonomous rule for Indians within the colonial empire.In 1921, a young freedom fighter by the name of Pingali Venkayya proposed a flag design to Gandhiji. This design was a combination of two colors- red and green which were representative of the Hindu and Muslim communities. Gandhiji recommended that a white strip may be added to provide inclusivity to the remaining minority communities of India and along with that, the incorporation of the spinning wheel indicates the progress of the nation.In 1931, the flag proposed by Pingali Venkayya was formally adopted except for one minor change which was that the red color was replaced with saffron. The spinning wheel was replaced with the Dharma Chakra of Emperor Ashoka and finally, on the landmark date of July 22, 1947, the national flag of India in its present form was adopted by the constituent assembly.It came to be widely known as the ‘tiranga’ due to its definite and proportionate bands of deep saffron, white, and dark green colors. These three colors in our flag are of great prominence and every color is said to hold certain beliefs and ideals of its own.Saffron is representative of courage, sacrifice, and strength of the country, the White middle band symbolizes truth and honesty. It also emphasizes the importance of maintaining peace in the country. The Green band is a symbol of prosperity, vibrancy, and life. It represents the growth, fertility, and auspiciousness of the land. Finally, the center of the Indian flag which contains the Ashok chakra has 24 spokes and is blue representing constant movement and progress. It represents motion or life in movement and death in stagnation.The Indian flag is considered highly sacred and pure and its dignity shall be upheld by the people of the country at all costs.Written By: Jia AhujaFeature Image Credits: india.com"

    "content": "Directed under the expertise of Amrit Sagar, 1971 is counted among the finest films created to date. With the impending 74th Republic Day, the movie still resonates in the heart of those who were silenced and forgotten. The movie, however, laid low on advertising and is easily obliterated just like the brave soldiers of the war of 1971.PLOT1971 is set against the milieu of the war fought between India and Pakistan 1971 for the liberation of Bangladesh. It deviously showcases the condition of 54 POWs, who never made it back to their homes. The movie is set up in the year 1977, six years after the war occurred, and narrates the attempts of Indian soldiers, trying to break free and return to their mother nation. Though the plot is fictitious, it successfully manages to portray the plight of soldiers languishing in the Pakistani cells and raise the question- what happened to those 54 Bravehearts?1971 is not what you expect a war movie to be. It is about the fight that is fought when war gets over. It imposes the question on the viewers- who suffers?The movie revolves around the character of Major Sooraj Singh, played by Manoj Bajpayee, and his other comrades who are trying to get back to their home which has forgotten them quite effortlessly.CASTWith the reliable cast Amrit chose, the chances of the movie being a success rose exponentially. Some of the quality actors in the industry like Manoj Bajpayee, Kumud Mishra, Manav Kaul, Deepak Dobriyal, and Ravi Kisan came together to make the splendid piece. Also, how can Piyush Mishra urf Major Bilal Malik’s iconic eye rolls go unmentioned?The screenplay resonates with the viewers and takes them on a ride of emotions. Where on one hand, Dobriyal and Kaul’s characters will take you on a roll, Bajpayee and Kishan will be sure enough to wrench your heart.TAKINGSThe famous poem by Wilfred Owen dulce et decorum est fits quite apt in the Indian context as well. With so much glorification associated with the honor of dying for one’s country, the movie certainly asks- is it worth it?It is nothing but a piece of cake to share your opinions with a blanket of protection wrapped all around you, while those who are genuinely on the field wear coffins on their head. Those who give up everything, end up being completely forgotten. How can we blame the world when suddenly you are not even important enough to be remembered by your home?CONCLUSIONWith the right blend of fine cinematography and just the right scriptwriting, 1971 makes up for a promising movie. While certain scenes could have worked better without the background score, on a wider spectrum it only enhances the scenes.What makes the movie so special, is it takes a different account of portrayal. Away from the stereotypical bloodshed and hatred-filled propaganda it observes and lets the viewer observe from a neutral lens.The events unfolding will keep you glued to your seat. What better occasion to remember our brave hearts than republic day? So, add it to your watch list for the 26th of January.Written By: Shruti_Feature Image Credits: _Justdial"

    "content": "Winters are liked by some, and disliked by some, by their own choice or due to the conditions. During cold waves, while we all sleep under our comfy blankets and eat and drink hot food, many low-income individuals face a difficult choice: should they use their limited resources to buy food or, to keep their homes warm? This is known as the “heat or eat” dilemma, a serious problem affecting many people living in poverty. They feel that instead of prioritizing hunger, they should prioritize warmth, as it is very hard to get through this chilly season for them.The lack of access to proper heating can lead to Hypothermia and Frostbite, which can be fatal if not treated promptly. In addition, many individuals living in poverty aren’t able to afford proper housing. Homelessness is a significant issue, and the cold weather can be especially dangerous for those who are forced to sleep outside. While the privileged section of society goes to more chilly areas to enjoy the seasonal snow, there are people who live under such poor conditions that they don’t have appropriate clothes which can provide them the needed warmth.To help in eliminating the “heat or eat” dilemma, there are a few things that can be done: Community organizations and shelters can provide warm clothing, blankets, and food to those in need. In addition, the government can provide financial assistance to help low-income individuals afford heating costs.It is also important to remember that the issue of poverty and its effects on health and well-being is not limited to the winter season. Addressing poverty and ensuring access to basic needs should be a priority year-round. Poverty is something that not only requires care and concern but also to take the initiative to provide the concerned individuals with the necessities they need.The “heat or eat” dilemma is a significant problem that affects many low-income individuals during cold waves. Sometimes several people in these families even share only one blanket to survive and the dilemma between food and warmth clearly shows how bad the situation is. To ensure a better future for all, it is important to come together and do something that solves this problem once in for all. So if you find someone who needs your help during these winters, do help them to make their day better along with yours!Medhavi Dubey &amp; Srishti SinghFeatured Image Credits: Uday Foundation"

    "content": "Delhi is experiencing a cold nightmare as temperatures drop to 1.8 degrees Celsius, but not everyone is staying indoors. I interviewed some auto-rickshaw drivers and guards in Shalimar Bagh who work at night, despite the thriving cold.Q1. What are the problems that you face working at night shift?Cold temperature is one of the problems we face. Not wearing proper clothes is dangerous in this weather.  Working for long hours at night causes severe illness, cold and flu. Due to bad weather, we can hardly see anything. For security reasons, we have to be careful of our surroundings.Q2. What measures do you take to stay warm while on long shifts in the cold?We usually sit on a chair under a tree next to the fire, with planks of wood. Since there is no guardhouse for us, we make sure to wear 2 jackets with warm woolen caps and gloves.Q3. How do you handle chilly weather conditions while on duty?We fire woods but you cannot trust the wood; that it can burn out anytime. We look for wood around. If it runs out, we have no other option than to work with it.Q4. How do you ensure that your equipment and gear, such as uniforms and boots, are properly maintained during the winter?This year the people in this block gave us warm jackets and blankets. We are paid Rs 12,000 a month and all of that money goes into running the household. Little money is left to buy warm clothes and shoes. Our little children go to school and we have to buy them warm clothes first so they don’t feel cold in this weather.Q5. Have you ever experienced problems with visibility while driving at night in cold weather?Yes, driving atnight in winter is a big risk due to dense fog. We use fog lights and headlights on low beams at night. We use the white lines on the road as a guide.Q6. How do you maintain visibility and mobility while on patrol in cold weather? And how do you maintain safety protocols at night?We use torch lights or headlamps to maintain visibility in low light conditions. To ensure our mobility we wear warm clothes and keep with us walking sticks. For safety purposes we keep ourselves updated with weather conditions by communicating with one another.Q7. Working at night in this cold weather is a difficult task, why did you choose the night shift for duty?If we do not give our duty at night, what will happen to those who are traveling at night. We get 5-6 customers at night and most of them are nurses and ward boys working in hospitals till late. We need to be on the streets are night, our job is important.Q8. How do you ensure the safety of your passengers during the night time ride?We make sure that the auto is in good working condition and we’ll maintain it. We are aware of the surroundings and avoid going into dangerous areas.  We also keep the door of the auto closed while driving and avoid driving when feeling down. We also avoid picking up passengers who are under the alcohol influence.Q9. How do you stay informed and updated on current weather conditions and forecast during your shift?We tune into the weather updates on Radio. We also rely on visuals in the sky; dark clouds or clear sky to make inferences about the weather.Q10. How do you stay alert and focused during long shifts in the dark and cold?We try and maintain a consistent sleep schedule. Additionally, we keep ourselves engaged by listen to radio or use mobile phones.Bhumi NagpalFeatured Image Credits: Bhumi Nagpal"

    "content": "What if we all started our days with a big “thank you” and a grateful heart? Well, honestly, I will be glad to live such a life where my day starts and ends with the same magic word: “thank you.” We all want to live the life we want and achieve our goals, but taking the time to thank those who helped us get there, who gave us a shoulder to cry on when we were about to give up, who filled us with hope, who listened when we had a lot to say, makes our lives more meaningful and joyful.We look at things differently when we feel differently, and adopting gratitude as a way of life can turn what we have into enough and more. The problems that come our way appear to be gifts; failures become successes, erroneous timing becomes perfect, and disjointed situations become valuable lessons.Gratitude has such a powerful impact that it can help change people’s lives.It fills one with optimism, boosts up our spirit and makes us feel more alive, and happier than before and at last it makes us feel changed but for the good.Dr. Steve Maraboli says, “At the end of the day, let there be no excuses, no explanations, and no regrets.” Inspired by his saying, I adapted the idea of gratitude, and I am glad to share how I feel about it. Welcoming each day as a blessing in life was the first step I took, and eventually, there was no looking back. Saying a random thank you for every moment of my life made me feel more optimistic; it filled me with joy and satisfaction.Every day before going to bed, I thank God for letting me witness a new day in life, for letting me realise the actual meaning of living, and last but not least, for letting me live a life well-equipped with all the necessities. With this change in my lifestyle, I have learned to be strong in all circumstances, to be happy with everything, to be content with what I have, and to not desire more. Human wishes are never-ending, and the biggest achievement in one’s life is being able to limit the desires. Gratitude helps achieve all this.In a nutshell, “If the only prayer you say in your life is thank you, that would suffice.” Once you become clear about what you are grateful for, you will start appreciating everything that happens in life. You will find pleasure in things that you previously took for granted, and that will be the best feeling you will ever experience. Today, start being grateful for your experiences rather than waiting for positive ones before being grateful.Vanya JainFeatured Image Credits: Metro Parent"

    "content": "The film starts with the lead singer, Qala, winning the Golden Vinyl Award for her song, wherein she gives an interview to the journalists. In the past, Urmila Manjushree (Qala’s mother) gave birth to twin babies, a boy and a girl. But the boy baby dies, and the doctor says sometimes the healthier twin takes the strength from the weaker twin, which has probably resulted in this. Qala was born in a gloomy, ghostly giant mansion in a snowclad town in Himachal Pradesh; she grows up without the warmth of her mother’s love, as Urmila is always hard on her. The cold weather is a symbol of the snowclad heart of Qala; she becomes really cold as her mother never treats her with love and warmth, and throughout, she tries to gain her attention and looks for her validation. Qala becomes a successful singer in the present day, but her mother is still absent from the plot. Qala hallucinates a boy in a turban with the snow falling on her.Her hallucinations from time to time haunt her and remind her of the bad deeds she has committed in the past. Going back in time, still yearning for her mother’s approval, Qala, a grown-up girl, makes her musical debut as a classical singer at a cultural event in Shimla, but her happy day turns into a night terror when a boy named Jagan outperforms Qala. Her already sorrowful life gets even more miserable when her mother adopts the orphan Jagan and takes him to her home. Jagan tries to form a bond with Qala and talks about the weather of the town being colder than Solan and having heavier snowfall than Shimla. The winters shown in the backdrop give chills to the audience and make them feel the cold present in the hearts of Qala and her mother. The cold weather symbolises the helplessness of Qala as she witnesses her own mother giving Jagan everything she craved for being her daughter, due to which she develops jealousy and hatred for Jagan, and that’s what makes her commit a sin. The film justifies its aesthetics by representing the despair and loneliness in the lead character’s life. The film also delivers a message on mental health as Qala gets into depression after Jagan’s suicide. The sight of Jagan hanging from a tree in the snow frightens her, and she blames herself for his suicide. Qala’s helplessness awakens the demon inside her, and she mixes mercury in Jagan’s glass of milk, as mercury is considered harmful for the voice.The film is a perfect portrayal of the hardships faced by a female in her personal life as well as in making her career. The end of the film shook the audience as the lead hung herself to death because of her mental health. Her dark past could not be shared with anyone; it killed her inside, and she ended up taking her life. The film hooks the audience until the climax and delivers a social message to society. It is a heartwarming film to watch during the winter months.Kashish MansooriFeatured Image Credits: Nowrunning"
